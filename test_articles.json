        "title": "Steve Moore Withdraws from Fed Nomination Process",
        "text": "Steve Moore, Donald Trump\u2019s pick to fill one of the open slots on the Federal Reserve\u2019s board of governors, has withdrawn from consideration.\n\n\u201cI was honored and grateful that you asked me to serve on the Federal Reserve Board,\u201d Moore said in a statement Thursday. \u201cI am respectfully asking that you withdraw my name from consideration. The unrelenting attacks on my character have become untenable for me and my family and 3 more months of this would be too hard on us.\u201d\n\nThe news was broken by President Trump on twitter.\n\n\u2026.and deregulation which have produced non-inflationary prosperity for all Americans. I\u2019ve asked Steve to work with me toward future economic growth in our Country. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 2, 2019\n\nThe withdrawal was sudden and unexpected. On Thursday morning, Moore told the Wall Street Journal that he wouldn\u2019t withdraw.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not pulling out,\u201d Moore said.\n\nMoore has been hounded in recent weeks by mainstream media attacks that focused on a handful of articles and speeches he wrote, some more than decades old, that alleged Moore had \u201cbelittled women.\u201d Questioned by journalists about Moore\u2019s writings, several Senate Republicans expressed doubts about the prospects of confirming him.\n\nA recent piece in the Wall Street Journal included excerpts from several of the articles. Its top example was a column from 1994 opposing the Violence Against Women Act sponsored by Joe Biden and others.\n\n\u201cProbably the most objectionable pork in the entire legislation is the $1.8 billion earmarked for Sen. Joe Biden\u2019s \u2018Violence Against Women Act.\u2019 That act sets up gender sensitivity programs for judges and police; classifies assaults against women as \u2018hate crimes\u2019 or civil rights offenses, and passes out millions of dollars to women\u2019s groups for \u2018rape education\u2019 and a smorgasbord of other programs. The act would be more efficient if Congress cut out the federal middleman and simply required every American household to write a $20 check to the radical feminist group of its choice.\u201d\n\nWhile voting against a bill called the \u201cViolence Against Women Act\u201d may seem shocking in the current \u201cme too\u201d era, thirty-eight Senators voted against the law in 1994, including two Democrats. It was opposed by moderate and conservative GOP Republicans, including Bob Dole, Orin Hatch, John McCain, Charles Grassley, Trent Lott, Dick Lugar, Jesse Helms, Kay Hutchinson, Richard Shelby, and Mark Warner. In the House, 195 Reps voted no.\n\nOther things cited by journalists included a call for banning women refs from men\u2019s college basketball, a 1990s column criticizing co-ed soccer for children, a 2000 column for National Review lamenting his wife\u2019s decision to vote for a Democrat, and comment to a GOP group last year in which Moore said that Republican women were more attractive than Democrat women. Many of the columns were intended to be humorous or sarcastic.\n\n\u201cHis writings contain language that sometimes echoes Mr. Trump\u2019s past comments about women on shock radio and on the infamous \u2018Access Hollywood\u2019 tape,\u201d the New York Times claimed.\n\nNone of the disputed columns touched on issues that would be directly relevant to a job on the board of governors of the Federal Reserve, which neither supervises college athletic refereeing nor evaluates claims of female attractiveness variability by political affiliation. But critics said \u201cthey contain controversial statements that could raise questions about Mr. Moore\u2019s actual views toward women,\u201d as the New York Times put it.\n\nMoore has been a severe critic of the Fed and last year called on Fed chair Jerome Powell to resign, a comment he later said he regretted. He has also questioned whether a central bank is necessary.\n\n\u201cI think we should have a discussion in this country about whether we need a Fed,\u201d Moore said in a Journal interview. \u201cWhy not just have a rule? A very simple price rule, and just make sure the Fed carries it out, and take as much discretion away from the Fed as possible.\u201d\n\nThose comments, however, were well known when the nomination was first floated months ago and were not responsible for moving GOP Senators against him, according to people familiar with the matter. Instead, it was the allegations about his writings mentioning women that pushed some Republicans into saying they would not support his nomination, those people said."

        "title": "Bokhari: Link-banning Is Facebook\u2019s Terrifying New Censorship Tool",
        "text": "The banning of multiple political commentators from Facebook and Instagram, including conservatives Paul Joseph Watson and Laura Loomer, is an outrage against the ideals of an open Internet on its own. But beyond the bans on individuals, Facebook has deployed an even more terrifying tool of censorship \u2014 link-banning.\n\nThe mainstream media were, of course, tipped off about the bans in advance, and the Atlantic\u2019s report contains the following eye-opening detail. Not only has Alex Jones\u2019 personal account now been banned from Facebook, in addition to PrisonPlanet editor-in-chief and YouTube star Paul Joseph Watson, but all links to Infowars sites are now banned across the platform. Share Infowars too often, and you\u2019ll be banned too.\n\nVia The Atlantic:\n\nInfowars is subject to the strictest ban. Facebook and Instagram will remove any content containing Infowars videos, radio segments, or articles (unless the post is explicitly condemning the content), and Facebook will also remove any groups set up to share Infowars content and events promoting any of the banned extremist figures, according to a company spokesperson. (Twitter, YouTube, and Apple have also banned Jones and Infowars.)\n\nThis takes censorship on social media to altogether new levels. If you post Infowars content on Facebook or Facebook-owned Instagram, your post will be removed. If you post it repeatedly, you will be banned.\n\nNote the wording, too \u2014 you\u2019ll be banned unless you\u2019re condemning Infowars. Facebook is now brazenly using its power to reward certain political positions and punish others.\n\nThis isn\u2019t censorship of an individual or a group over a violation of terms of service. It\u2019s the wholesale ban of an independent media site, which for all the criticism levied against it, has had a major impact on the politics of the United States.\n\nAnd Facebook has made no pretense, as it has in other cases where the pages of news sites have been banned, that the ban occurred because of alleged \u201cinauthentic behavior,\u201d by which it means the use of multiple pages or automated accounts to promote a site\u2019s content.\n\nThat Facebook is dispensing with its previous excuses shows that the social network has become emboldened to regulate the flow of news on its platform, knowing that no consequences are headed its way from Republicans on Capitol Hill or in the White House.\n\nThrough algorithm changes and the prioritization of so-called \u201cauthoritative sources,\u201d Facebook has spent the last two years positioning itself to control the news you see on your feed. Now it\u2019s taken control of the news you share with your friends too. Post a link to a disapproved website? It\u2019ll be deleted. Post it again? You\u2019ll likely be banned.\n\nThis is a formula not just for banning websites, commentators, and political figures, but for banning all their supporters as well.\n\nAnd because their bans nearly exclusively target the right, potentially thousands of Republicans and Trump supporters won\u2019t be able to use Facebook to encourage their friends to vote on election day 2020 \u2014 a massive advantage for the Democrats on one of the internet\u2019s most politically influential platforms.\n\nPresident Donald Trump may have cooled on sources like Infowars (unlike his campaign days, when he appeared on Alex Jones\u2019 show). But this isn\u2019t just an attack on particular individuals or sources. Whatever your criticisms of Infowars \u2014 and there are many \u2014 this is an attack on the independent media as a whole. It\u2019s an unprecedented tilting of the scales in favor of Democrat-approved media, and it will have an enormous impact on the 2020 election.\n\nThat\u2019s the point of course. Since Trump won in 2016, Silicon Valley has been animated by a single mission \u2014 ensure it never happens again.\n\nBeyond the leaks showing that Facebook is deliberately deboosting conservative figures (when it isn\u2019t outright banning them), that YouTube and Google are pushing conservative content out of their top search results, just look at the video-recorded weeping of Google executives on stage after Trump won. They hate him, they hate his supporters, and they will do everything they can to suppress them before election day. The only question is, what\u2019s Trump going to do about it?\n\n"

The administration may not dictate the terms of a hearing in this hearing room,\u201d he said.\n\nNadler had wanted staff members to question Barr at the hearing, which the Justice Department called \u201cunprecedented and unnecessary.\u201d Republican said Democrats were trying to make the hearing appear to be an \u201cimpeachment\u201d hearing, and not an oversight hearing.\n\nNadler also wanted Barr to agree to a closed-door session to discuss the redacted portions of Mueller\u2019s report.\n\nBarr objected to those terms and warned the chairman he would not appear if he insisted on that format. The two sides are reportedly negotiating a May 15 appearance.\n\nHe did, however, testify to members of the Senate Judiciary Committee for six hours on Wednesday.\n\nNonetheless, Nadler framed Barr\u2019s refusal to appear as part of the destruction of the nation\u2019s system of government and accused the president of wanting to make congressional oversight \u201cinert.\u201d\n\nHe issued Barr another warning: \u201cYes, we will have no choice but to hold the attorney general in contempt if he stalls or fails to negotiate in good faith.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he does not provide this committee with the information it demands, the respect it deserves, Mr. Barr\u2019s moment of accountability will come soon enough,\u201d he added.\n\nRep. Steve Cohen (D-TN) showed up to the hearing with a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken to suggest that Barr was a chicken for not testifying.\n\nThe top Republican on the committee, Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA) fired back, blasting Nadler for what he said was a \u201ccircus political stunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reason Bill Barr is not here is because the Democrats decided they didn\u2019t want him here today. That\u2019s the reason he\u2019s not here,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is amazing to me is to say that he\u2019s scared of answering questions\u2026yesterday he sat for six hours in the Senate voluntarily answering questions.\u201d\n\n\u201cYesterday he proved he\u2019s not terrified to sit before anybody, especially the Senate, which they extended the question time on. He answered the questions,\u201d he added. \u201cYou can agree with the attorney general or disagree with the attorney general but not hearing from him is a travesty for this committee today.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question I have here is not what Bill Barr is scared of. My question is what are the Democrats scared of? They don\u2019t want Bill Barr here today.\u201d"

        "text": "South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg landed a TIME magazine cover \u2014 and a glowing review.\n\nAn inspirational headline overlaid a picture of Buttigieg and husband Chasten: \u201cFirst Family \u2014 The unlikely, untested and unprecedented campaign of Mayor Pete Buttigieg,\u201d it read. And, after recounting a time when Buttigieg was harassed by a man wearing a devil costume, the writer asserted that some Americans might see the 2020 Presidential candidate as someone who might \u201cjust be the man to vanquish America\u2019s demons.\u201d It continues:\n\nButtigieg is a gay Episcopalian veteran in a party torn between identity politics and heartland appeals. He\u2019s also a fresh face in a year when millennials are poised to become the largest eligible voting bloc. Many Democrats are hungry for generational change, and the two front-runners are more than twice his age.\n\nButtigieg is gaining perception as a young, progressive, charismatic answer to Trump, and it is a reputation with which he seems very comfortable. \u201cIf the substance of your ideas is progressive, but there\u2019s mistrust about them among conservatives, you have three choices,\u201d he told the magazine:\n\nOne is to just change your ideas and make them more conservative. The second is to sort of be sneaky and try to make it seem like your ideas are more conservative than they are. And the third, the approach that I favor, is to stick to your ideas, but explain why conservatives shouldn\u2019t be afraid of them.\n\nAnd neither TIME nor Buttigieg himself were shy about making a direct comparison:\n\nIn many ways, Buttigieg is Trump\u2019s polar opposite: younger, dorkier, shorter, calmer and married to a man. His success may depend on whether Democrats want a fighter to match Trump, or whether Americans want to \u2018change the channel,\u2019 as Buttigieg puts it. \u2018People already have a leader who screams and yells,\u2019 he says. \u2018How do you think that\u2019s working out for us?\u2019\n\nThe 4,100-word piece dives into Buttigieg\u2019s childhood, military service, and marriage. He is fighting an almost unprecedented battle against other major Democrat contenders for the Oval Office. Suffolk University Political Research Center Director David Paleologos told Fox \u201cButtigieg leads Biden, Sanders, and every other Democrat among LGBTQ households \u2014 an important demographic for grassroots support and a network of generous and loyal donors.\u201d\n\nWith former vice president Joe Biden as the clear front runner according to recent polls, it remains unclear whether Buttigieg has the ability to mount a real challenge for the nomination, and displace his chief rival: Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. Right now, it is virtually anybody\u2019s game."

        "title": "Exclusive--Ortiz: Left-Wing Investigation Tries and Fails to Slam Tax Cuts",
        "text": "On Tuesday, a far-left, George Soros-backed outfit known as the Center for Public Integrity and the socialist British newspaper The Guardian released an 11,000-word report chronicling the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The investigation, which didn\u2019t produce any newsworthy findings, was as banal as it was long.\n\nEmbarrassingly, for its corresponding article, The Guardian was forced to go outside the report\u2019s run-of-the-mill reporting for its headline \u201cfinding\u201d: supposedly that workers received just six percent of the tax cuts\u2019 benefits. This figure is based, not on the report, but on a shoddy analysis done by a separate activist group. (Even the left-wing Tax Policy Center finds that 85 percent of the tax cut savings this year go to families earning less than around $400,000 a year.) The Guardian article\u2019s headline is, \u201cWorkers barely benefited from Trump\u2019s sweeping tax cut, investigation shows.\u201d No doubt this is what the newspaper wanted the investigation to show. Yet, it didn\u2019t.\n\nSo what did the report find? Mainly that passing the tax cut legislation, which brought the corporate tax rate in line with the developed world, created a new deduction for small businesses and eliminated the hated linchpin of Obamacare (the individual mandate), was long and arduous work. Newsflash: There\u2019s some sausage-making that goes into the legislative process.\n\nBecause lowering the corporate tax rate to similar levels as Europe, providing overdue relief to small business job creators, and doubling (and making refundable) the child tax credit aren\u2019t exactly controversial, the report focuses on the budgetary impacts of the legislation. While the national debt is obviously a concern, and it\u2019s true that the tax cuts add about $100 billion a year to the deficit, this represents less than 10 percent of the budget deficit. Given that tax revenue has increased since tax cuts took effect, the deficit is clearly the result of too much government spending, not a lack of tax revenue. Such deficit concerns should be addressed during the budgeting process.\n\nWeirdly, the report portrays the contemporaneous predictions of economic growth from the tax cuts \u2014 now proven true \u2014 as voodoo economics: \u201cRosy estimates of economic growth were summoned from right-wing pro-growth think tanks.\u201d Left unsaid is the three percent growth climate that the tax cuts have produced. Last week, the Bureau of Economic Analysis announced that first-quarter economic growth was 3.2 percent. Average economic growth over the last five quarters, since the tax cuts took effect, has been above three percent \u2014 the fastest pace since 2005. This growth rate, which is 50 percent higher than the average under President Obama, is about exactly what tax cut proponents \u2014 like chief White House economist Kevin Hassett \u2014 predicted.\n\nContrast these vindicated predictions to the critics who claimed three percent growth could never happen and now have egg on their faces. Former Obama White House Chief Economic Advisor Larry Summers said you\u2019d have to \u201cbelieve in tooth fairies and ludicrous supply-side economics\u201d to think tax cuts could spur three percent growth.\n\nAre the tax cuts perfect? No, but they have delivered as promised, raising economic growth, boosting wages, creating jobs, spurring investment, bolstering retirement savings accounts, making childcare less fiscally challenging, and improving lives. It takes pretty big partisan blinders to argue otherwise.\n\n"

Some of his past satirical articles about women in sports seem to have come into play among some U.S. Senators who said they could not support his nomination.\n\nIn a public statement, the economist thanked the president for considering him.\n\n\u201cI was honored and grateful that you asked me to serve on the Federal Reserve Board,\u201d Moore said in a statement. \u201cI am respectfully asking that you withdraw my name from consideration.

And while making the case for getting rid of female referees and vendors at college basketball games, Moore asked aloud if there was any area in life \u201cwhere men can take a vacation from women.\u201d\n\nLast Sunday, on ABC\u2019s This Week, Moore was \u201capologetic\u201d over the old columns.\n\n\u201cThey were humor columns, but some of them weren\u2019t funny, and so I am apologetic. I\u2019m embarrassed by some of those things I wrote,\u201d Moore told George Stephanopoulos.\n\nBut Moore also noted that he thought the attack was a distraction from his qualifications on economic matters. \u201cI\u2019ll debate anybody on economics\u2026 Let\u2019s make this about the economy,\u201d he said.\n\n"

Former co-president of Fox News Bill Shine was ousted from the conservative network in May 2017 after becoming embroiled in the high-profile sexual harassment scandal that had enveloped the outlet.\n\nShine oversaw the departure of former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes, who was forced to resign after a 20-year career after former anchor Gretchen Carlson filed suit against him \u2013 and ultimately joined by others \u2013 who alleged sexual misconduct. He died shortly thereafter. Shine, for his part, remained a staunch defender of the serial abuser.\n\nThe move is yet another shameful indication of Fox News\u2019 entrenchment in this administration. A network that once billed itself as \u201cfair and balanced\u201d \u2013 a title that it finally shed in a rare glimpse of self-acknowledgment \u2013 is not only serving as a mouthpiece for the administration, but staffing it.

Trump adding another unqualified shill whose shameful failure to protect women amid the #MeToo movement is par for the course in a White House that operates more like a C-grade reality show than the respected institution that it once was.\n\n"

Vice News reports:\n\nAmong the performers at the concert was Luke Combs, a featured artist of \u201cNRA Country,\u201d an arm of the gun rights organization that has partnered with the country music industry for the past several years in effort to reach younger audiences.\n\nNRA Country sponsored Luke Combs as their \u201cFeatured Artist\u201d for November, and he conducted a promotion with the gun lobby\u2019s group, whose infamous insistence of absolute gun rights has long been the most feared voice in the Republican political universe.\n\nCombs\u2019 sponsorship is part of the NRA\u2019s outreach to young people, who they desperately need to persuade that America\u2019s hideous gun violence is normal in the face of every other civilized country in the world having sensible gun laws. The NRA\u2019s website explains:\n\nNRA Country is a celebration of American values. Respect. Honor. Freedom. It\u2019s a lifestyle and a bond between the best and brightest in country music and hard-working Americans. NRA Country will be involved in causes that defend our values and it will empower our artist friends who promote these values to encourage our next generation of leaders.\n\nShamefully, Combs has posted multiple messages on social media about his own safety, yet steadfastly refuses to speak to his 700,000 social media followers about the lax gun laws that permit literally anyone off the street to buy high-volume magazines and assault-style rifles, which ultimately led to the mass murder of his fans at a show.\n\nLuke Combs has taken to social media three times since the Las Vegas massacre. hasn\u2019t once addressed the root cause of the murder of 58 of his fans and injury to over 400 people, which is about 1 of every 50 people who paid to see his act.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t once addressed the root cause of the murder of 58 of his fans and injury to over 400 people, which is about 1 of every 50 people who paid to see his act.\n\nActive shooter at @Route91Harvest in Vegas.

(full complaint below)\n\nFederal law makes it a crime for the President to wrongfully influence a private entity\u2019s employment decisions, such as calling for a reporter to be fired for speaking out for partisan political reasons. In fact, the President is expressly included in the ethics law Congress set forth to prevent Presidents from using the \u201cbully pulpit\u201d in a fascist manner to direct the efforts of private businesses.\n\nOur Constitution\u2019s First Amendment protects the right to free speech and no public servant, not even the President, is allowed to tell an American citizen what they may or may not say. The Democratic Coalition released this statement along with the complaint:\n\nHere's my full statement regarding Trump's #TakeAKnee comments, which led to the ethics complaint filed against him by @TheDemCoalition. pic.twitter.com/G79NeP25Ix \u2014 Jon Cooper (@joncoopertweets) September 25, 2017\n\nToday\u2019s criminal ethics complaint against Trump is punishable by fines, and up to 15 years in prison if the President is ultimately charged, tried and convicted of the crime.\n\nThe relevant part of the federal law 18 USC 227 (a)2 reads:\n\nWhoever, being a covered government person, with the intent to influence, solely on the basis of partisan political affiliation, an employment decision or employment practice of any private entity influences, or offers or threatens to influence, the official act of another, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than 15 years, or both, and may be disqualified from holding any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States. In this section, the term \u201ccovered government person\u201d means the President, Vice President, an employee of the United States Postal Service\u2026\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s comments also raise the specter of abusing his powers of office to retaliate against the NFL for his past business mismanagement problems.\n\nTrump famously sued the NFL under anti-trust laws in the 1980s as part of the competing USFL, and the jury even found in favor of his then-defunct league.\n\nTrump won an embarrassingly pyrrhic victory in court when the jury found in his favor, but only awarded him a penalty of $3 after the jury noted his partners described the league\u2019s problem as \u201cwe have met the enemy and he is us.\u201d\n\nThe USFL promptly folded, like most of Trump\u2019s business ventures.\n\nPresident Trump just spent his entire weekend flying to Alabama to attack an African-American athlete, and then followed it up with a hail of official statements on Twitter going after multiple athletes and urging sports leagues to fire them.\n\nYet, he defended the Nazis in Charlottesville multiple times; those who participated in events leading to Heather Hayer\u2019s bloody murder on the streets, in broad daylight.\n\nBut this latest Democratic Coalition complaint points out that President Trump\u2019s actions aren\u2019t just the acts of a plain and open white supremacist; Trump\u2019s racist statements are being made for partisan political reasons and are therefore illegal.\n\nIn America, nobody is above the law, especially not laws explicitly written by Congress to keep the President\u2019s stubby, meddling hands out of private business decisions.\n\n\n\n"

        "text": "Brenda Hurd\u2019s ultimatum for her son Jarrett is a well-known story in the Hurd household. She told Jarrett by the time he turned 25, she wanted to see real progress in his boxing career \u2014 or else he\u2019d not only have to move on from the sport, but out of the house, as well.\n\nThese days, depending on who you ask, there\u2019s disagreement on whether she actually meant it.\n\n\u201cShe really wasn\u2019t going to do anything to him,\u201d said Fred Hurd, Jarrett\u2019s father.\n\n\u201cOh yes, I was,\u201d Brenda said.\n\nJarrett Hurd, however, didn\u2019t doubt his mother.\n\n\u201cOh, she was definitely serious,\u201d Hurd said. \u201cIf my career wasn\u2019t turning out the way it was and I was having ups and downs in boxing, then she\u2019d [have] sat me down and said, \u2018Jarrett you gotta start thinking about something else than boxing.\u2019\u201d\n\nFortunately for the Hurds, that discussion never happened. When Hurd turned 25, he was already fighting on television and on the undercard of some of the world\u2019s best fighters. The following year, he won his first title \u2014 becoming the International Boxing Federation (IBF) junior middleweight champion.\n\nNow at 28 and a unified champion, Hurd is preparing for another title defense \u2014 this time just a few miles away from his hometown of Accokeek, Maryland. On May 11, Hurd (23-0, 16 knockouts) will face Julian Williams (26-1-1, 16 KOs) at EagleBank Arena in Fairfax, Virginia. The fight, televised on Fox, is Hurd\u2019s first local bout since 2014.\n\nThrough it all, Hurd still lives at home with his parents. But his life also significantly changed after becoming a champion.\n\nWhen Hurd goes for a run, for example, he\u2019s recognized. Cars honk and spectators stop him for pictures. He\u2019s also being recognized outside his local community: He has partnered with the Washington Redskins to become a \u201cteam ambassador.\u201d Fancy title aside, several players from the Redskins will walk Hurd to the ring on May 11 \u2014 with the boxer wearing burgundy and gold trunks.\n\nOutside of the perks, Brenda Hurd said her son becoming a champion set him down a clear path.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s focused on his goals,\u201d Brenda Hurd said. \u201cHe\u2019s not wandering off, \u2018Oh, let me go party over here and all that.\u2019 He stays really focused and when he sets a goal, he just goes toward that.\u201d\n\nIn boxing, it\u2019s typical for fighters to map out their career. If Hurd beats Williams, for instance, the 28-year-old wants a fight with Jermell Charlo, one of the other titleholders in his division. Then after that, Hurd plans on remaining in his weight class until the end of 2020 \u2014 and then he\u2019ll eventually move up to middleweight.\n\nHurd, though, is starting to expand his interests away from the ring. He has become interested in promoting fights, forming his own promotional company, \u201cSwift Promotions.\u201d He said he wants to \u201cbe the face of the DMV\u201d and bring back fights to the area. He also plans to work closely with other local fighters to prop them up. Hurd has sought business advice from his manager, Al Haymon, and worked closely with his former promoter, Ross Molovinsky.\n\nBut first, Hurd\u2019s main priority is to beat Williams. This will be Hurd\u2019s first test since undergoing surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff in June 2018. In his last fight, which took in December, Hurd easily dispatched Jason Welborn in four rounds, but that was a tuneup fight.\n\nWilliams, on the other hand, is ranked as the eighth-best junior middleweight by The Ring magazine and has won four straight.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very dangerous,\u201d said Ernesto Rodriguez, Hurd\u2019s trainer. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s going to come in the best shape ever. I think that he\u2019s going to put on a good fight and going to be an entertaining fight for everyone.\u201d\n\nAs for Hurd\u2019s living situation, Brenda Hurd said Jarrett is talking about moving out at the end of the year.

        "title": "Digital technology offers new ways to teach lessons from the Holocaust",
        "text": "When it comes to understanding the horrors of the Holocaust, most millennials are woefully lacking in knowledge. That much was laid bare in a 2018 study commissioned by the Claims Conference \u2013 an organization that supports survivors of the Holocaust.\n\nFor instance, the study found that nearly half of all millennials \u2013 that is, those born from the early 1980s through the 1990s - are unable to name even one of the more than 42,000 camps and ghettos in existence during the Holocaust. The same study found that 41 percent of millennials believe that substantially fewer Jewish people were murdered during the Holocaust than the accepted 6 million figure.\n\nThe Centre for Holocaust Education at the University College London found similar gaps in knowledge. For instance, the University College London study found that a third of England\u2019s high school students \u201cmassively underestimated the scale of the murder of Jewish people.\u201d\n\nThis is a problem when you consider that millennials and young people worldwide have entered or will soon enter classrooms in the United States and elsewhere as teachers.\n\nI\u2019ve found similar deficits in knowledge in my own research into Holocaust education. Several years ago, I conducted a study that measured what student teacher candidates in New Jersey knew about the Holocaust.\n\nThe study \u2013 which is soon to be published in the journal The Social Studies \u2013 found that teachers had giant gaps in their knowledge. Their responses prompted me to probe deeper.\n\nDeficits in knowledge\n\nIn my survey of nearly 200 future teachers, I found that only 30 percent knew that the Jewish people were the primary victim of the Holocaust. Even fewer knew the correct century in which the Holocaust took place. Auschwitz was the only concentration camp they identified \u2013 although, in their responses, the teaching students spelled it 28 different ways.\n\nThis past fall \u2013 spurred in part by a rise in anti-Semitism \u2013 I conducted a follow-up survey to measure if these future teachers were learning anything more than in the past. The sample was modest but representative - 75 students, all on track to become teachers in another year or so. All had attended New Jersey public schools.\n\nWhen the student teachers saw the questions, they groaned and uttered things such as, \u201cI can\u2019t believe I don\u2019t know this.\u201d (If you want to figure out how you might have done on the survey, you can ask yourself if you know the answers to the following survey questions: When did the Holocaust take place? What was the political party that perpetrated the Holocaust? Who were the victim groups? Who was the American president? What other genocides can you identify?)\n\nAfter they completed the survey, the student teachers immediately began to search for the correct answers online. They were disappointed to see just how far off they were. One student teacher after another placed the Holocaust in the 1800s. Others listed Ronald Reagan as the American president during the Holocaust. Perhaps most disturbingly, many listed the number of victims in the thousands, which falls way short of the actual figure.\n\nDigital lessons emerge\n\nEvery person cannot be expected to know every single facet of the Holocaust. At the same time, it\u2019s deeply disturbing when large segments of the population don\u2019t know basic facts about one of the most horrendous atrocities \u2013 actually a series of atrocities \u2013 ever perpetrated against humanity.\n\nKnowing about the Holocaust is a vital part of historical understanding. It is a means of promoting tolerance and inclusion. And it also serves as a form of innoculation against future atrocities.\n\nFortunately, new advances in learning about the Holocaust through digital humanities offer new ways for American students and teachers \u2013 or anyone who cares to learn more about the Holocaust - to learn about an event that took place nearly three-quarters of a century ago.\n\nHere are three examples:\n\nCourtroom 600\n\nThe University of Connecticut recently unveiled Courtroom 600, a project that places users inside the courtroom at the Nuremberg trials where Nazis and collaborators were tried. This project, still in prototype form, allows users to engage with virtual reality technology in order to interact with a fictitious member of the United States team of prosecutors. It also enables users to read primary source documents, gather evidence and prosecute select defendants.\n\nIWitness and holograms\n\nAnother digital resource is available through the University of Southern California Shoah Foundation. The foundation, perhaps best known as the holder of thousands of Holocaust survivor testimonies, has created the IWitness program. This is a collection of 1,500 testimonies of survivors and witnesses to genocide \u2013 the Holocaust, as well as others like the Nanjing Massacre in China. The testimonies can be searched by subject. There are also ready-made lessons for teachers that can be accessed from anywhere and used freely at any time.\n\nThe Shoah Foundation has also recently launched 3D holograms of survivors, giving users the experience of having a conversation with a survivor rather than passively viewing testimony. This project, called Dimensions in Testimony, is groundbreaking. It encourages students and others to engage with survivor testimony in new ways. For instance, each survivor hologram is able to participate in a \u201cconversation,\u201d with responses to commonly asked questions about faith, life before, during and after the war.\n\nDigital source documents\n\nFinally, a partnership between the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Wiener Library in London, and the International Tracing Service in Bad Arolsen, Germany, has produced two online sourcebooks that feature primary sources that deal with the Holocaust. These online sources focus on the camp system and women under Nazi persecution.\n\nEach guide provides images of primary sources found in the International Tracing Service database, descriptions, questions to guide conversation and further avenues of investigation for students. A high school teacher who is using these guides \u2013 even though they were originally intended for university-level classes \u2013 told me that the documents are easy to modify. She uses them to discuss how to read and engage with primary sources.\n\nThe International Tracing Service in Bad Arolsen has also produced an \u201cITS e-guide,\u201d intended to help families and scholars better understand the vast array of paperwork that was produced for any given survivor or victim of the Holocaust. By clicking on an image of a document, users are able to learn more about what the document was used for, how to decode it, who created it, and what to consider when reading the document. Examples include prisoner registration cards, malaria cards and personal effects cards. These artifacts show the great lengths that Nazis went to keep records \u2013 even as they carried out one of the most horrific massacres that humanity has ever experienced.\n\nUltimately, there is not a single solution for the challenges that face Holocaust education. Still, these digital examples all move teaching and learning from passively reading textbooks to actively engaging with history.\n\nAs for the answers to the survey questions I mentioned above, the Holocaust took place from 1933 to 1945. The victim groups included Jews, Poles, Roma and Sinti, homosexuals, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, people with disabilities and other groups deemed inferior. The American president during the Holocaust was Franklin D. Roosevelt. Other genocides in the 20th century include the Armenian, Cambodian, Rwandan and Bosnian genocides."

        "text": "With the Pentagon closely watching the unfolding crisis, U.S.-backed Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido and his supporters struggled Wednesday to rally enough momentum on the streets of Caracas in their effort to oust socialist President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nA day after calling for both the populace and Venezuela\u2019s military to rise up against Mr. Maduro, there were again large protests and counter-protests, but Mr. Guaido acknowledged that not enough of Mr. Maduro\u2019s generals have deserted him so far to declare an outright victory.\n\n\u201cWe have to acknowledge that yesterday there weren\u2019t enough [military defectors],\u201d he said as he addressed a group of supporters, according to wire service reports.\n\n\u201cWe are not asking for a confrontation,\u201d Mr. Guaido, the speaker of the opposition-dominated National Assembly who has declared himself \u201cinterim president,\u201d added. \u201cWe are not asking for a confrontation among brothers, it\u2019s the opposite.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Trump administration and more than 50 nations have backed Mr. Guaido\u2019s claim to power, Diosdado Cabello, a Maduro ally and head of the ruling Socialist Party, mocked the opposition\u2019s claims and insisted the armed forces remain loyal to the regime.\n\nSpeaking at a pro-Maduro rally Wednesday, Mr. Cabello said opposition leaders are now \u201cwalking like zombies\u201d after failing to provoke the widespread uprising urged by Mr. Guaido on Tuesday morning, The Associated Press reported.\n\nAcross town at the Carlota air base near where Mr. Guaido made his surprise call Tuesday morning for a revolt, intense clashes between protesters and troops loyal to the government made clear the standoff would drag on, AP reported. State security agents launched tear gas and fired rubber bullets, while bands of mostly young men armed with makeshift shields threw rocks and set a motorcycle ablaze.\n\nBy late afternoon, many of the anti-government protesters in the capital appeared to be drifting home.\n\nWith U.S. National Security Adviser John R. Bolton and other top Trump aides turning up the rhetorical heat on Mr. Maduro and key allies such as Cuba and Russia, U.S. military officials said Wednesday they are monitoring the situation closely. Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan canceled a planned trip to Europe to monitor events in the oil-rich South American nation.\n\nAppearing before a congressional committee Wednesday, Mr. Shanahan insisted the military option remained on the table and said the Pentagon has done \u201cexhausting planning, so there\u2019s not a situation or scenario that we don\u2019t have a contingency for.\u201d\n\nWhile there were clashes and clouds of tear gas again on the streets of Caracas on Wednesday, President Maduro mocked what he said was the failure of the opposition to turn out the massive streets protests Mr. Guaido call for the day before in announcing the \u201cfinal phase\u201d of the uprising to unseat the government.\n\n\u201cIt was demonstrated that interference, coups and armed confrontation are not the way for our beloved Venezuela,\u201d Mr. Maduro tweeted Wednesday. Mr. Maduro and his allies accuse the Trump administration of trying to engineer a coup.\n\nBack in Washington, top Pentagon officials told Congress they hoped diplomatic and economic pressure could end the crisis, but said U.S. forces were prepared to play a role if ordered to.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing what we can now to collect intelligence to make sure we have good visibility on what\u2019s happening down in Venezuela,\u201d Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. told a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing Wednesday morning.\n\nBut Adm. Craig S. Faller, commander of U.S. Southern Command, which would oversee any potential U.S. military operation in Venezuela, told the House Armed Services Committee that he has not received orders to pre-position troops.\n\nMr. Bolton earlier in the day said U.S. troops were \u201con the balls of their feet\u201d prepared to take action if the situation deteriorated. The U.S. and its allies say Mr. Maduro\u2019s 2018 reelection victory was so riddled with fraud that he is no longer the country\u2019s legitimate leader.\n\nCritics say Mr. Maduro\u2019s policies have devastated Venezuela\u2019s economy and sparked a humanitarian and refugee crisis that has destabilized virtually all of the country\u2019s neighbors.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo called Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov on Wednesday and \u201curged Russia to cease support for Nicolas Maduro and join other nations,\u201d according to a State Department spokesperson. He warned Mr. Lavrov that \u201cintervention by Russia and Cuba is destabilizing for Venezuela and for the U.S.-Russia bilateral relationship.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Staff writers Guy Taylor and Ben Wolfgang contributed to this report, which was based in part on wire service reports."

        "text": "The House delivered a searing rebuke Tuesday to President Trump, voting to overturn his border emergency wall building declaration in a floor showdown Democrats said was nothing short of a historic stand against tyranny.\n\nThe victory, however, could be short-lived.\n\nThe vote sends the bill to the Senate, which will vote sometime in March, and appears likely to pass the resolution. But Mr. Trump has vowed a veto, and Tuesday\u2019s 245-182 vote shows that while the president couldn\u2019t muster a majority, there is more than enough GOP support to sustain his veto.\n\n\u201cThis emergency declaration will be upheld,\u201d said House Minority Whip, Steve Scalise, the Louisiana Republican is in charge of GOP vote-counting. \u201cUltimately, we are going to stand with the president in making sure we can secure this border and confront this national crisis that\u2019s taking lives every single day.\u201d\n\nThat does not, however, mean the debate is painless for Mr. Trump, who will likely see another loss in the Senate next month, and who will likely have to use his veto for the first time in his administration.\n\nAnd the president could suffer political damage, having failed to convince most Americans of the need for his wall, and facing a bipartisan rebuke on Capitol Hill.\n\nDemocrats cast the vote as a constitutional clash between a runaway president and a Congress intend on defending democracy.\n\n\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s time for our country to have a civics lesson,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi chided her GOP colleagues, telling them to live up to their oath of office to defend the Constitution.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to give any president, Democrat or Republican, a blank check to shred the Constitution of the United States,\u201d she said. \u201cWe would be delinquent in our duty as members of Congress if we did not overturn what the president proposed.\u201d\n\nRepublicans though said Mr. Trump was acting under clear emergency powers Congress granted in the 1976 National Emergencies Act.\n\nThat law does give the president powers to shift money around in times of emergency. The law also gives Congress a path to block him, by passing a resolution of disapproval.\n\nThat\u2019s what the House did Tuesday.\n\nThirteen Republicans joined Democrats in voting against Mr. Trump. But that\u2019s well short of the 53 House Republicans who\u2019d need to vote with all Democrats in order to achieve the two-thirds majority required to overturn a veto.\n\nThe measure does, however, go to the Senate, where it must be voted on within 15 business days.\n\nVice President Mike Pence met with GOP senators over lunch to try to limit defections. Several members of the Republican Conference have already said they\u2019ll join Democrats to vote against Mr. Trump.\n\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell said it was a \u201cvery fulsome\u201d discussion.\n\n\u201cI personally couldn\u2019t handicap the outcome at this point,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the House, GOP leaders cast Tuesday\u2019s vote not as a constitutional clash but rather a statement about the situation on the border. They said that from what they can see, the president is right to declare an emergency.\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger, Illinois Republican, just returned from a border deployment with the Wisconsin Air National Guard, and he said the emergency isn\u2019t so much immigration \u2014 he said he supports a broad bill to legalize immigrants living in the U.S. without permission \u2014 but rather with drug-smugglers and with \u201ccoyotes\u201d who lead migrants on the dangerous journey north.\n\n\u201cA wall, a barrier, is not compassionless. I think border security and compassion actually go hand-in-hand,\u201d Mr. Kinzinger said.\n\nCongress earlier this month approved $1.375 billion in new wall money. Mr. Trump signed that bill, but then declared the border emergency and said he\u2019ll move $3.6 billion from military construction money to use for more border wall building. He also said he\u2019ll tap $600 million from a Treasury Department forfeiture fund, and $2.5 billion from a Pentagon drug interdiction fund.\n\nOnly the military construction money needs the emergency declaration.\n\nAll told, the administration envisions building at least 200 miles of new fencing with the money.\n\nHypocrisy was rife on both sides in Tuesday\u2019s vote.\n\nNearly every Republican in the House in 2014 voted to rebuke President Obama for executive overreach on Obamacare, in a vote authorizing the House to sue him for spending money Congress had specifically cut out of that year\u2019s budget.\n\nYet on Tuesday most of them applauded Mr. Trump for spending beyond the $1.375 billion Congress approved for border wall construction.\n\nMeanwhile Democrats, who cheered Mr. Obama when he spent the Obamacare money over Congress\u2019s objections and praised him when he created a deportation amnesty for \u201cDreamers,\u201d immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally as children, by executive action in 2012, called Mr. Trump a unique threat to democracy.\n\n\u201cThe Congress of the United States needs to have a spine and not lay at the feet of the president of the United States and say \u2018Whatever you want, sir!\u2019\u201d thundered Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer, Maryland Democrat.\n\nThe 13 Republicans who joined Mr. Hoyer and other Democrats in bucking Mr. Trump were Reps. Justin Amash and Fred Upton of Michigan, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Mike Gallagher and F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. of Wisconsin, Jaime Herrera Beutler and Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, Will Hurd of Texas, Dusty Johnson of South Dakota, Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Tom Rooney of Florida, Elise Stefanik of New York, and Greg Walden of Oregon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 100 percent in favor of President Trump\u2019s wall, and today\u2019s vote had nothing to do with the need to build it,\u201d Ms. McMorris Rodgers tweeted. \u201cFor the same reason I was against President Obama using his \u2018pen and phone,\u2019 I voted to disapprove of this unilateral executive action.\u201d\n\n"

        "text": "For White House National Security Adviser John R. Bolton, this one is personal.\n\nThousands of miles from the chaos that erupted in Caracas, Venezuela, on Tuesday, Mr. Bolton directed a string of unusually sharp threats at socialist President Nicolas Maduro and found himself embroiled in a Twitter war of his own with one of Mr. Maduro\u2019s top deputies.\n\n\u201cYour time is up,\u201d Mr. Bolton tweeted to three top Venezuelan officials. \u201cThis is your last chance. Accept Interim President [Juan] Guaido\u2019s amnesty, protect the Constitution, and remove Maduro, and we will take you off our sanctions list. Stay with Maduro, and go down with the ship.\u201d\n\nMr. Bolton\u2019s hard-charging rhetoric underscores a central reality of the Venezuelan crisis: The Trump administration has nearly as much riding on the outcome in Caracas as its ally on the ground, opposition leader Juan Guaido.\n\nThroughout the day, when many in the international community were appealing for calm, Mr. Bolton, joined by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Vice President Mike Pence and later President Trump, seemed positively eager to ratchet up the tension in a bid to force Mr. Maduro from power.\n\nSince January, the White House has led a broad international coalition in rejecting Mr. Maduro and recognizing Mr. Guaido, Venezuela\u2019s young political opposition leader, as the nation\u2019s rightful president. The socialist government, U.S. officials contend, is responsible for driving Venezuela\u2019s oil-rich economy into the ground and sparking the largest humanitarian and refugee crisis in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nMr. Bolton also seems heavily invested in the outcome on a personal level, going beyond other administration officials in public comments castigating the Maduro regime. He threatened U.S. intervention and expressed unwavering solidarity with Mr. Guaido, who was urging his supporters to mount a full-on rebellion.\n\nIn November, Mr. Bolton lumped Venezuela into a \u201ctroika of tyranny\u201d with leftist governments in Cuba and Nicaragua and has shown no inclination to tone down the rhetoric.\n\nAlthough the Maduro government accused Washington of orchestrating the rebellion, Elliott Abrams, the State Department point man on the crisis, seemed to suggest that the U.S. did not anticipate Mr. Guaido\u2019s declaration at dawn.\n\n\u201cWhat was going to happen, we were told, was that they would announce their support for the constitution,\u201d he told reporters at the State Department, The Associated Press reported. He said the situation on the ground in Venezuela \u201cremains confused.\u201d\n\nShould the U.S. gambit fail, critics surely will cast Mr. Bolton as the face of an unsuccessful American strategy in South America while increasing the prestige of Mr. Maduro and his leftist allies in the region.\n\nVenezuelans will recall that a previous U.S. government made a major miscall of its own when the George W. Bush administration in April 2002 gave initial support to a coup that briefly ousted populist Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez, Mr. Maduro\u2019s political mentor. The uprising fizzled, and Mr. Chavez died in office 11 years later.\n\nWith Venezuela\u2019s military seeming to stick \u2014 for now \u2014 with the president, the Maduro regime responded to the uprising with a violent crackdown. Dozens of people were being treated for injuries late Tuesday.\n\nEven amid that crackdown, top Venezuelan officials took time to trade barbs with Mr. Bolton on Twitter. They highlighted how the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations has become the face of America\u2019s Venezuela policy.\n\n\u201cDream on, @AmbJohnBolton \u2026 Not today!\u201d Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza tweeted in direct response to Mr. Bolton\u2019s threat.\n\nMr. Bolton held a hastily arranged press conference outside the White House on Tuesday afternoon to reject assertions that the uprising amounted to little more than an American-led coup. He called out top Maduro allies by name to defect to the opposition and again stressed that all options, including military force, remained on the table.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing the Venezuelan people strive to get a government that they control, not \u2026 an authoritarian military regime,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is clearly not a coup. We recognize Juan Guaido as the legitimate\u201d president of Venezuela.\n\nShould Mr. Guaido\u2019s revolution succeed, Mr. Bolton said, the administration is fully prepared to work with the new government in Caracas and would even organize a conference on the benefits and economic opportunities a post-Maduro Venezuela could expect.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been planning for what we call the day after, the day after Maduro, for some time,\u201d he said.\n\n"

The Trump administration, which has strongly backed Mr. Guaido, quickly signaled its support.\n\nIn a tweet, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said \u201cthe U.S. government fully supports the Venezuelan people in their quest for freedom and democracy. Democracy cannot be defeated.\u201d\n\nVice President Mike Pence tweeted \u201cWe are with you! America will stand with you until freedom & democracy are restored. Vayan con dios! #FreeVenezuela\u201d\n\nThe video, shot near an air base in an opposition-controlled section of Caracas, also featured Leopoldo Lopez, a longtime opposition leader and rival to Mr. Maduro who had not been seen since being held under house arrest by the government.\n\nMr. Lopez said he was released from house arrest \u201cto the order of the Constitution and President Guaid\u00f3,\u201d and was at the military base with Mr. Guaido. He called on his supporters to \u201cmobilize,\u201d and \u201cconquer freedom.\u201d\n\nJorge Rodriguez, the country\u2019s information minister, referred to Mr. Guaido\u2019s move as a \u201ccoup d\u2019etat against the Constitution and the peace of the Republic\u201d in a tweet, translated from Spanish. He said the Venezuelan government is \u201ccurrently confronting and deactivating a small group of traitor military personnel.\u201d\n\nThe minister called on the Venezuelan people \u201cto remain in maximum alert so that, together with the glorious Bolivian armed forces, we defeat this attempted coup and preserve peace. We will win.\u201d\n\nMr. Guaido has recently been traveling the country drawing large crowds at rallies, calling on the Venezuelan people to push out President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nHe said in the video that the country\u2019s armed forces and \u201cvaliant men connected to the constitution have come to our calling, we have come to this calling.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, the Maduro government launched an internal offensive against Mr. Guaido, whom the U.S. and several Latin American and European powers backed after what they say was Mr. Maduro\u2019s fraud-ridden re-election vote last year.\n\nDespite having been stripped of his parliamentary immunity by the Maduro government, which set the stage for his potential arrest and prosecution on allegations he violated the constitution by declaring himself interim president in January, Mr. Guaido has vowed to fight on and has called for nationwide rallies on May 1.\n\nSpeaking to CNN Tuesday morning, Communications Vice Minister Isbemar Jimenez said \u201cthe situation is under control \u2026 All military garrisons support Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.\u201d\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican and outspoken critic of Mr. Maduro, called on Venezuela\u2019s military to support Mr. Guaido\u2019s opposition movement.\n\n\u201cThis is the moment for those military officers in #Venezuela to fulfill their constitutional oath & defend the legitimate interim President @jguaido in this effort to restore democracy,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cYou can write history in the hours & days ahead.\u201d\n\n"

        "text": "Norwich \u2014 The South Kingstown, R.I., superintendent for the past 10 years and 2017 Rhode Island Superintendent of the Year was selected unanimously Tuesday as the new head of the Norwich public school system.\n\nKristen E. Stringfellow, 52, who earned her doctorate degree in school finance and teaches the subject at Providence College to prospective school administrators, will become the new Norwich school superintendent beginning July 1. She will succeed Abby Dolliver, who is retiring June 30.\n\nThe Board of Education unanimously approved a three-year contract Tuesday with a starting salary of $185,000. The board skipped a planned executive session to review the contract at the start of Tuesday\u2019s meeting, conceding to the overwhelming support for the top finalist candidate, who spent the entire day Tuesday touring all Norwich schools except the preschool centers, and interacting with students.\n\nHer husband, Peter, daughter Samantha and sons P.J. and Jake, all Stringfellows, and her mother, Judith Provorse, attended Tuesday\u2019s meeting and tour of the Kelly Middle School prior to the meeting.\n\nStringfellow said she was attracted to the Norwich school district because of its preschool through eighth grade structure. Norwich sends most high school students to Norwich Free Academy and has numerous other designated high schools. She said she has served as assistant superintendent for 10 years and superintendent for another 10 years in districts with high schools, but also that had experience with paying tuition for students\u2019 enrollment at charter schools and sent other students to private or parochial schools.\n\nBut overseeing education in younger grades, Stringfellow said, is her passion.\n\n\u201cThe focus on K through eight is a dream come true,\u2019\u2019 Stringfellow said after the vote. She said she has followed a lot of the Norwich school district\u2019s initiatives in reading and writing and even the Choose Love social and emotional learning program. She said Rhode Island has few magnet schools, and she is \u201cvery interested in the magnet school concept,\u201d referring to Norwich\u2019s two magnet middle schools and two magnet elementary schools.\n\n\u201cI just think this is a district that focuses on children and their well-being and their academic achievement,\u201d Stringfellow said, \u201cand so I want to be a part of that.\u201d\n\nStringfellow said she is finalizing a 100-day plan for her transition to Norwich schools. On Tuesday, she met the teachers\u2019 union president, all principals, the principals\u2019 union president, and several staff members, and toured every building.\n\n\u201cI plan on attending night events, weekend events as much as I can between now and July 1,\u201d she said.\n\nOnce she starts on July 1, she plans to spend a day with each building principal, each board member, key city leaders and NFA leaders.\n\nStringfellow was selected from 26 initial applicants and two finalist candidates, Board of Education Chairwoman Yvette Jacaruso said. Her expertise in school finance \u201cjumped right out at us,\u201d Jacaruso said, saying the district needs a financial \u201cmagician\u201d to help deal with chronic budget crises and rising costs.\n\nStringfellow said she is working on a \u201csustainable\u201d budget for the Norwich district that \"will lead us into the future.\u201d\n\nShe will take over a school district with a projected $2.4 million budget deficit in the current school year, and a proposed budget that likewise is some $3 million lower than what the Board of Education requested.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly a challenge,\u201d Stringfellow said of the budget problems, \u201cbut it\u2019s certainly something that I am good at and it\u2019s something I can lend my expertise to. I know it will be difficult, but I am not afraid of that challenge.\u201d\n\nStringfellow started her career in education as an elementary school teacher in East Providence, Cranston and Providence. She became a principal in Scituate and later assistant superintendent in Scituate and in East Providence before becoming the South Kingstown superintendent 10 years ago.\n\nStringfellow currently is president of the Rhode Island Superintendents\u2019 Association. She earned her bachelor\u2019s degree in psychology and education at Rhode Island College, a master\u2019s degree in early childhood/elementary education at Rhode Island College and her administration degree at Providence College. She earned her doctorate in educational finance from Johnson and Wales University.\n\nJacaruso called Stringfellow personable and approachable, along with being a strong leader and experienced professional.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very, very proud as the chairman of the board to have selected Kristen Stringfellow as our new superintendent,\u201d Jacaruso said.\n\n"

That would give victims to age 56 to file a lawsuit.\n\nThe revised bill, known as Senate Bill 3, also would give victims 21 and older five years from the date of the assault to file a lawsuit.\n\nThe original bill would have given victims older than 48 a 27-month window to file a lawsuit regardless of their age. Supporters of the provision had pointed out that many victims who have been abused by Catholic priests often do not reveal their abuse until much later in life, on average in their 50s.\n\nThe Day is seeking records about which Judiciary Committee member recommended eliminating the 27-month window in favor of the provision that gives victims to age 56 to file a lawsuit.\n\nWhile increasing the window to file a lawsuit by eight years will benefit some victims, the change still comes as a bitter disappointment to those older than that who only recently came forward to say they were abused.\n\n\u201cIt leaves a lot of people like me in a hole,\u201d said John \u201cTim\u201d McGuire, 60, of New London, who offered emotional testimony about being sexually assaulted by a priest during a Judiciary Committee public hearing last month.\n\nMcGuire had broken down as he told committee members how, when he was an 8-year-old altar boy, he was sexually assaulted by the late Rev. James Curry at St. Joseph\u2019s Church in Noank and how it has affected his life.\n\nMcGuire discovered he had missed the filing deadline by three weeks when he first decided to come forward 12 years ago. Now, with the proposed change to age 56, he would miss the filing deadline by four years.\n\nMcGuire pointed out that the average age for people to reveal they were abused is in their early to mid-50s, which means many victims are older than that.\n\nMcGuire said he was disgusted with how he\u2019s seen the legislative process unfold.\n\nHe said that while victims \u201cpoured their hearts out\u201d at the public hearing, behind the scenes the state\u2019s Catholic dioceses used a high-powered lobbyist to convince the committee to make the change instead of addressing it in public.\n\n\u201cWhat reason is there not to compensate victims of child rape?\u201d he asked.\n\nMcGuire said he and other victims of priest abuse are working with the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests and lawyers who represent victims to try to convince legislators to restore the original language of the bill before a vote.\n\nThe bill also would increase the time to criminally prosecute sexual assault and strengthen protections for those who are victims of sexual harassment.\n\n"

        "text": "Get the weekly rundown Sign up to receive our weekly BizBuzz newsletter Email* Submit\n\nThe head of the Connecticut Airport Authority said discussions over Tweed New Haven Airport and the potential to develop more commercial service there in the future are not interfering with ongoing efforts to try to restore commercial service at Groton-New London Airport.\n\nThe Groton airport is the only one of the authority's five general aviation airports that has the certification to allow passenger commercial airline service.\n\n\"There is nothing occurring right now that will change the direction that we've set for Groton-New London Airport, which calls for the development of that airport and in particular commercial airline service at that airport,\" CAA Executive Director Kevin Dillon said in a phone interview Monday.\n\nTweed is owned by the city of New Haven and operated by the Tweed New Haven Airport Authority. The CAA has begun early conversations with the city and airport authority based on the need to coordinate and ensure activities at Bradley International don't hinder plans for Tweed, he said. The discussions could result in an agreement for CAA to operate the Tweed New Haven Airport, a direct acquisition or a plan to coordinate activities more closely, he said.\n\nDillon said Tweed New Haven represents an opportunity to develop a \"southern tier\" airport for commercial service and to attract a sizeable passenger base from Fairfield County and potentially eastern New York. Tweed already has some American Airlines service to Philadelphia and Charlotte, according to CTNewsJunkie.com, which also has reported the negotiations with the CAA.\n\nThe negotiations ultimately may have no impact on Groton-New London Airport's potential for commercial passenger service, particularly if they only result in an agreement to coordinate activities, Dillon said.\n\nFrom a system standpoint, there are only so many airlines to land planes at airports in one geographic area. If significant levels of commercial service were to be developed at Tweed in the future, it makes it less likely that commercial service would be developed at airports in close proximity, he said.\n\n\"There's a reality that has to factor into where development dollars are being spent,\" he said.\n\nWhile the CAA is not involved, Dillon pointed out that Sikorsky Memorial Airport, another municipally owned airport, where The Connecticut Post has reported there is a proposal to restore commercial service, is also very viable for commercial service. Conversely, if commercial airline service were restored at Groton-New London, it potentially could affect other airports.\n\nHe said expansion of commercial service at other airports doesn't necessarily mean the CAA would give up Groton-New London Airport's certification for commercial passenger service, for which it pays $250,000 annually. If eliminated, it would be difficult to restore.\n\nNo decisions have been made, and right now scenarios about stepped up commercial service at Tweed are hypothetical, he said.\n\n\"We're a long way from that happening at this point,\" he said. \"We're in very preliminary conversations.\"\n\nDillon said runway length issues also have posed a challenge to developing additional service at Tweed. Proposed legislation to allow the extension of the runway is making its way through the legislature, he said.\n\nCommercial airline service at Groton still a goal\n\nThe airport authority hopes to restore commercial passenger service at Groton-New London Airport, which ended about 15 years ago, and is continuing to talk to carriers, he said.\n\nDillon told The Day's Editorial Board last fall that commercial passenger service from Groton-New London Airport to Washington, D.C., is a goal worth pursuing. The authority had been in discussions last year with an airline carrier interested in providing that service, but plans for the carrier to acquire another carrier to provide the aircraft capacity fell through.\n\nGroton-New London Airport has a 5,000-foot main runway and 4,000-foot crosswind runway, which doesn't limit commercial service but does limit options, he said. Typically, airports need a runway length of a minimum of 6,000 feet to offer a service viable to commercial activity, he said, but many times airports that lack runways of that length still pursue commercial service, looking for niche aircraft.\n\nThe Groton-New London Airport has a \"very viable terminal building\" and offers a market, with the region's tourism industry and casinos, that is attractive to certain carriers, he said.\n\nDillon said the airport authority is trying to stress to the business community that if the authority is to restore commercial passenger service to Groton-New London, there has to be a level of commitment to use the service.\n\nWith the growth of area companies key to service development, the CAA plans to coordinate another round of outreach to the business community, hopefully within the next few months, to collect updated data that would demonstrate to carriers the market in the region, he said. Data would include the top five markets for a business to have service to or from and how many trips annually the company would expect to generate.\n\nPaige Bronk, Groton's economic and community development manager, said town officials have maintained a dialogue with local airport officials and the CAA.\n\n\u201cWe clearly advocate for increased service at the airport, but we also realize there has to be a partnership between our existing anchors and the CAA in order to entice a commercial operation,\" he said.\n\nHe said much of Groton's approximately 40,000 annual flights are related to Pfizer, Electric Boat, the Naval Submarine Base and casinos. He said there's clearly a need, but it's a matter of finding the right program.\n\nBronk said one of Groton's strengths is the ability to pull from the Rhode Island market. He pointed out that the discussions for Groton-New London Airport have focused on providing limited service, potentially to Washington, D.C.\n\n\"I don\u2019t necessarily think that limited service would be a competition or replacement for whatever is going to take place at Tweed,\" he said.\n\n"

        "text": "Drone regulations still don\u2019t permit most flights over crowds and urban areas, limiting where Wing can operate. (Photo: Wing)\n\nAn offshoot of Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google has become the first drone operator to receive government approval as an airline, an important step that gives it the legal authority to begin dropping products to actual customers.\n\nThe subsidiary, Wing Aviation LLC, now has the same certifications that smaller airlines receive from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and the Department of Transportation. It plans to begin routine deliveries of small consumer items in two rural communities in Virginia within months, the company said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an exciting moment for us to have earned the FAA\u2019s approval to actually run a business with our technology,\u201d Wing Chief Executive Officer James Ryan Burgess said in an interview. He called it \u201cpivotal\u201d both for his company and the drone industry in general.\n\nDrone regulations still don\u2019t permit most flights over crowds and urban areas, limiting where Wing can operate. But the approvals signed by the FAA on Friday and Monday give the company the ability to charge for deliveries of clients\u2019 goods in Virginia and apply for permission to expand to other regions.\n\nWhile scores of companies working in test programs have gotten FAA waivers to perform demonstration flights or to make deliveries over short distances, there has never been a drone company approved under the regulations designed to ensure safety at traditional charter airlines or smaller air-cargo haulers.\n\nIt required Wing to create extensive manuals, training routines and a safety hierarchy \u2014 just as any air carrier must do.\n\nCompanies receiving permission must also be majority owned by U.S. citizens under long-standing restrictions imposed by the DOT.\n\nBecause the idea of drones flying over people\u2019s homes is so new, the company plans to conduct extensive outreach to local government leaders and the public, Burgess added. Actual deliveries are expected to start within several months.\n\nMark Blanks, director of the Virginia Tech Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership, which has been working with Wing on tests of the deliveries, said \u201cwe\u2019ll be working with the community a lot more as we prepare to roll this out.\u201d\n\nThe people living in the neighborhoods where tests were conducted ranged from academics at the university to farm hands, Blanks said. Wing and university representatives have contacted many of them to ensure they were comfortable.\n\n\u201cAcross the board everybody we\u2019ve spoken to has been pretty excited,\u201d he said.\n\nWing provided extensive documentation to support its application, including records of thousands of safe flights conducted in Australia in recent years, according to the FAA.\n\n\u201cThis is an important step forward for the safe testing and integration of drones into our economy,\u201d Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said in the release.\n\nSome drone companies have complained that the process of obtaining air-carrier certification was too onerous. Many of the requirements that made sense for a charter airline \u2014 like flight attendants and seat belts for the crew \u2014 didn\u2019t apply to them.\n\nBurgess said that the process of applying to the FAA took months and was \u201cvery rigorous and very thorough.\u201d\n\nOther drone companies applying for FAA approvals should be able to move more quickly now that the agency and Wing have worked through the issues of what rules should apply to drone operators and which ones should not, Burgess said.\n\nThe FAA\u2019s air-carrier certification was needed because existing rules created strictly for drones don\u2019t allow the kind of flights Wing envisioned, he said.\n\nAccording to regulations issued in 2016, for example, drone operators are allowed to fly for hire, but have to do so within strict rules prohibiting flights outside of a ground operator\u2019s eyesight. Similarly, the FAA has allowed automated flights over longer distances, but they are only demonstrations and companies can\u2019t accept payment.\n\nIn order for Wing to operate over longer ranges and actually charge for the service, it needed to become a full-fledged air carrier. The FAA confirmed the air-carrier certification was signed, but didn\u2019t offer additional comment.\n\nWing plans to begin deliveries in the Blacksburg and Christiansburg areas of Virginia. The company has been conducting research at nearby Virginia Tech.\n\nUnlike Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s Prime Air, another would-be drone delivery company, Wing will sell items from local merchants. Now that it has gotten FAA approvals, it will begin finding business partners in the two towns, Burgess said.\n\nWing\u2019s drone, a hybrid between a helicopter and plane, is able to lift off vertically and fly horizontally at high speeds. It carries packages in its belly, lowering them to people\u2019s yards with a tether while it hovers a safe distance overhead.\n\nThe company also recently won approval for drone deliveries from regulators in Australia, where it has conducted extensive testing.\n\nThe FAA\u2019s approval demonstrates the rapid maturation of drone technology, Burgess said.\n\n\u201cIt shows these devices can be value-added in our communities,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can be a faster, cleaner, less expensive way to transport things while still adding to the safety of society.\u201d\n\n"

The grounding of Boeing Co.\u2019s 737 Max will cause a drag of about 0.2 percentage point on U.S. economic growth in the second quarter, Wells Fargo & Co. forecast on Tuesday. (Photo: Elaine Thompson / AP, file)\n\nThe grounding of Boeing Co.\u2019s 737 Max will cause a drag of about 0.2 percentage point on U.S. economic growth in the second quarter, Wells Fargo & Co. forecast on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe major negatives will be slower equipment spending and export growth during the quarter,\u201d senior economists Tim Quinlan and Sarah House wrote in a note. \u201cThose drags will be almost offset by an inventory boost as the undelivered aircraft test storage capacity at production facilities and unused airfields.\u201d\n\nProduction cuts and halted deliveries of Boeing\u2019s best-selling aircraft after two fatal crashes will ripple through components of gross domestic product and other economic indicators for months, according to the analysis, which cited industrial production, durable goods and shipments. The impact on durable goods orders \u201ccould be substantial if airlines delay new orders until safety concerns are addressed or book with a competitor,\u201d the economists wrote.\n\nAdjusted for the Boeing issues, Wells Fargo gave a second-quarter growth forecast of 2.5 percent, down from 2.7 percent.\n\nIt\u2019s still not clear when global regulators will clear the Max to resume commercial flights. Chicago-based Boeing is still working on a redesign of the anti-stall system implicated in two fatal crashes. The model is the latest version of the 737, the aviation industry\u2019s best-selling jetliner family, racking up more than 10,000 deliveries over a half century.\n\nHalted 737 Max shipments indicate second-quarter equipment spending and exports in the \u201care likely to take a significant hit,\u201d the economists said, because nearly three-quarters of the aircraft were exported last year. Reversing the stoppage will potentially boost growth in the second half, depending on when the all-clear is given, the analysts wrote.\n\nBoeing this month cut 737 production for the first time since the Sept. 11 attacks, saying it will temporarily move to a rate of 42 per month in mid-April from an earlier pace of 52.\n\nWhile work slows in Boeing\u2019s main Seattle-area factory, much of the 737 supply chain continues to move full steam ahead at the previous production pace. Running hot allows companies like Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc., which builds the jet fuselages, to avoid layoffs that might further disrupt the economy.\n\nCancellations, not just fewer new orders, would also reduce the total value of U.S. durable goods orders, Wells Fargo said.

        "text": "The Democratic-led House voted Thursday to recommit the U.S. to the Paris climate accord negotiated by former President Barack Obama that his Republican successor is trying to tear up.\n\nThe 231-190 vote was largely symbolic, since the House action stands no chance of clearing the Republican-controlled Senate. But it did offer a rare display of \u201cgreen\u201d unity for Democrats, who have been split recently between party moderates backing more practical approaches to climate change and far-left members of the party pushing for a radical restructuring of the U.S. economy.\n\nResuscitating the Paris accord, even symbolically, gives Democrats of all stripes political talking points.\n\n\u201cAmerica does not cut and run. America keeps its commitments,\u201d said the measure\u2019s sponsor, Rep. Kathy Castor, Florida Democrat.\n\nThe Paris climate deal included commitments made by most of the world\u2019s nations to limit greenhouse gas emissions over future decades. It has no binding provisions, but rather is a political document that nations were left to fulfill as they could.\n\nSince it didn\u2019t bind the government Mr. Obama never submitted it to the Senate as a treaty, instead taking executive and regulatory actions to try to create the conditions for the U.S. to cut its emissions.\n\nPresident Trump campaigned against the deal and after he took office in 2017 he announced the U.S. would withdraw. That move won\u2019t be finalized until Nov. 4, 2020, at the earliest \u2014 just days before the next presidential election.\n\nMs. Castor\u2019s bill, the first piece of climate change legislation passed by the House this term, would require the U.S. honor Mr. Obama\u2019s commitments such as cutting emissions by 26% below their 2005 levels by the middle of the next decade. The bill sets the ultimate aim of eliminating carbon emissions altogether.\n\nDemocrats say remaining part of the Paris accord is critical to U.S. leadership.\n\n\u201cClimate change is a national security threat the transcends borders and requires international coordination,\u201d said Rep. Eliot Engel, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nRepublicans contend meeting the Paris goals would cost the U.S. over $200 billion and 2.7 million jobs by 2025, and many argue that the country is already at its lowest carbon emission levels since 2000.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, Florida Republican, says the GOP must grapple with global warming and his party has \u201ctoo many climate deniers,\u201d but he said he couldn\u2019t support the bill because of the impact it would have on the economy.\n\n\u201cJust because the Earth is warming and humans contribute doesn\u2019t mean that President Obama got a good deal for the United States and the U.S. taxpayers,\u201d he told reporters Wednesday. \u201cBecause either there is no requirement for any action at all \u2014 and this is virtue signaling \u2014 or the structure of the Paris accord seems to be the outlay of U.S. cash initially and then the hope of other countries meeting their emissions goal.\u201d\n\nThe House Democrats\u2019 bill is less sweeping than the far-left wing\u2019s proposed Green New Deal, which not only set a goal of zero emissions but also called for a universal jobs guarantee, expanding government health care and other changes to the social safety net.\n\nDemocratic leaders acknowledged their measure wasn\u2019t as bold as some left-wing activists had demanded, but said it\u2019s only an initial foray.\n\n\u201cThe first step in any journey does not get you there, but without it, you get nowhere,\u201d Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said on the House Floor on Wednesday.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said it\u2019s likely to be a futile foray, saying Democrats\u2019 bill \u201cdoesn\u2019t even pass the laugh test.\u201d\n\n\u201cHouse Democrats may see this as exciting political theater. But the middle-class Americans I represent give it two thumbs down,\u201d he said. \u201cThis futile gesture to handcuff the U.S. economy through the ill-fated Paris deal will go nowhere here in the Senate.\u201d\n\nHe said the U.S. is making progress on cutting emissions without being tied to the Paris accord.\n\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated earlier this year that American emissions increased by 2.8% in 2018, after several years of cuts. The EIA predicted that 2019 will see another cut in emissions.\n\nThe Rhodium Group, a research group, released its own study putting emissions higher, at a 3.4% increase. They said the U.S. would have to cut emissions by 2.6% for the next seven years in order to meet the goals set in the Paris accord.\n\nThe rest of the world is also struggling.\n\nAccording to the Climate Action Tracker, only five countries \u2014 India, Ethiopia, Morocco, the Philippines and Gambia \u2014 are on track to cut emissions enough to meet the Paris agreement\u2019s minimum goal of holding warming to 2 degrees Celsius.\n\nThe U.S. is one of five \u2014 along with Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia \u2014 marked as critically insufficient.\n\n"

        "text": "Article Tools Font size \u2013 + Share This\n\nA state historical marker commemorates the 1979 nuclear accident at Three Mile Island Unit 2, but the controversy for the state government now is whether to subsidize Unit 1 to maintain its carbon-free power production. (Associated Press File)\n\nGov. Tom Wolf has made Pennsylvania the 24th state to join the U.S. Climate Alliance, under which state governments attempt to achieve goals established by the Paris Accord on Climate Change \u2014 in defiance of President Donald Trump\u2019s blunder in withdrawing from the accord.\n\nIt is the right position, even though it is clearer than the state\u2019s air that there is no consensus within the state government to wage the fight.\n\nIdeology energizes cross-purposes\n\nAs Wolf announced a plan to reduce statewide carbon emissions by 80 percent by 2050, Republican House Speaker Michael Turzai conducted another event announcing his caucus\u2019 Energize PA plan. It is fundamentally a collection of state government tax giveaways to the gas industry.\n\nIn addition to major tax credits akin to the $1.7 billion the state has committed to build a Shell petrochemical refinery in Beaver County, the package would require the public to subsidize construction of local gas-distribution pipelines, and strip the state Department of Environmental Protection of its permitting authority over gas wells.\n\nTurzai, citing a study funded by energy and other businesses, claimed that the package would create a $60 billion increase in state GDP and 100,000 new jobs.\n\nMultiple contradictions\n\nGas is a fossil fuel. The GOP gas plan thus contradicts Wolf\u2019s climate plan. The governor also endorsed the gas industry, but called on it \u2014 without specific regulations to make it happen \u2014 to reduce the vast amounts of methane that escape during drilling and processing. Methane is distinct from carbon and produced in smaller quantities, but it is a much more powerful agent than carbon dioxide in trapping heat in the atmosphere.\n\nThe plan also contradicts Wolf\u2019s effort to impose a reasonable severance tax on gas production to fund $4.5 billion in borrowing for a major infrastructure program. Turzai\u2019s plan bestows public subsidies on the gas industry to help it build its own infrastructure.\n\nBy supplanting coal as the state\u2019s primary fuel for power generation, gas already has put the state well on the road to achieving the governor\u2019s proposed carbon reduction. Wolf proposed a 26 percent carbon emission reduction by 2025 from the baseline recorded in 2005. The state\u2019s carbon emissions declined by most of that, 23 percent, from 2005 through 2016.\n\nControversial, but carbon-free nukes\n\nMeanwhile, a highly controversial matter is in play. Nuclear power provides about 20 percent of the state\u2019s electrical generation, all of it carbon-free. Exelon has threatened early closure of its Three Mile Island nuclear plant if the state does not authorize subsidies for it in the form of required power purchases. At 805 megawatts, it is the smallest of the state\u2019s five nuke plants, producing just over 8 percent of their combined 9,707 megawatts. But the state can\u2019t subsidize one reactor without including the others. If one or more plants go offline, gas likely will replace the generation \u2014 increasing rather than decreasing the state\u2019s carbon production.\n\nThe governor has not specifically endorsed any nuke bailout plan in the Legislature, but his carbon-reduction plan assumes that the current rate of nuclear power production will continue. Without it, the goals will be unreachable.\n\nWolf\u2019s plan identifies many sound, proven means to reduce carbon emissions, such as promoting renewable energy production and reducing demand through better stewardship by everyone, from simply turning off lights in empty rooms and using energy-efficient appliances and more electric vehicles.\n\nUnfortunately, like most other policy in Pennsylvania, climate change is not so much a matter of electrical power as it is political power struggles."

        "title": "Democrats ramp up pressure on Trump as Pelosi accuses Barr of 'crime'",
        "text": "Democrats intensified their pressure on President Donald Trump\u2019s administration on Thursday as U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused Attorney General William Barr of committing a crime by lying to lawmakers and a key committee chairman threatened to hold Barr in contempt of Congress.\n\nEven as Democratic lawmakers accused the Trump administration of a growing attack on U.S. democracy and the authority of Congress, the White House showed no sign of backing down. White House legal counsel Emmet Flood said in a defiant letter that Trump had the right to tell advisers not to testify to congressional panels on the findings of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia inquiry.\n\nThe dueling statements marked a sharp escalation in the conflict between the White House and Democrats who control the House of Representatives. With Trump seeking re-election next year, Democrats are weighing whether to try to remove the Republican president from office using the impeachment process while pressing forward with demands for information on his taxes, businesses and other topics.\n\nShortly after Barr refused to appear before the House Judiciary Committee, Pelosi accused him of lying to lawmakers about interactions with Mueller after the special counsel ended a 22-month investigation into Russia\u2019s efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election to boost Trump\u2019s candidacy.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a crime,\u201d Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress, told reporters, referring to Barr\u2019s congressional testimony.\n\nJustice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec called Pelosi\u2019s allegation \u201creckless, irresponsible and false.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have accused Barr of misleading Congress by testifying in April he was unaware of any concern by the special counsel\u2019s team about Barr\u2019s initial March 24 characterization of the report, an account that led Trump to claim full exoneration. Barr failed to mention a March 27 letter he got from Mueller complaining that Barr\u2019s March 24 account did not \u201cfully capture the context, nature and substance of this Office\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nJudiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler threatened to hold Barr in contempt of Congress if he does not provide a full, unredacted copy of Mueller\u2019s report and the underlying evidence, as the panel has requested by a subpoena that had a Wednesday deadline. That could potentially lead to legal steps against the top U.S. law enforcement official.\n\nBarr released Mueller\u2019s report on April 18, with some parts blacked out to protect sensitive information.\n\nSeveral Democrats have called on Barr, whom Trump appointed after firing Jeff Sessions as attorney general, to resign.\n\nPelosi and other House Democrats previously had cautioned against launching the impeachment process, which would begin in the House but would face long odds of success in the Republican-controlled Senate and could alienate voters ahead of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nBut Pelosi said the Trump administration was continuing to ignore congressional subpoenas and noted that Congress launched impeachment proceedings against President Richard Nixon after he resisted similar demands. Nixon resigned in 1974 over the Watergate scandal.\n\n\u2018OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE\u2019\n\nPelosi said Trump\u2019s \u201cblanket statement that he\u2019s not going to honor any subpoenas is obstruction of justice.\u201d\n\nThe White House signaled little appetite to cooperate.\n\nTrump told Fox News in an interview on Thursday he was not inclined to let former White House counsel Don McGahn testify before congressional committees. Nadler has issued a subpoena for McGahn to testify in its investigation of possible obstruction of justice by the president.\n\nU.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) speaks at her weekly news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., May 2, 2019. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas\n\nTrump told Fox News that McGahn had already spoken to Mueller\u2019s team for 30 hours and allowing him to testify to Congress would open the door to others being called.\n\n\u201cI would say it\u2019s done,\u201d Trump said.\n\nFlood reiterated that point in a letter seen by Reuters, saying Trump\u2019s decision to let advisers cooperate when Mueller was conducting his investigation did not extend to congressional oversight investigations now that the inquiry had been completed.\n\nFlood also said Mueller\u2019s 448-page report suffered from \u201can extraordinary legal defect\u201d by failing to determine whether Trump had committed the crime of obstruction of justice.\n\nMueller \u201cinstead produced a prosecutorial curiosity - part \u2018truth commission\u2019 report and part law school exam paper,\u201d Flood wrote to Barr in a letter dated a day after the report was released.\n\nDemocrats have argued Trump waived the right to assert executive privilege - which allows a president to withhold information about internal executive branch deliberations from other branches of government - by allowing advisers to cooperate extensively with Mueller.\n\nBarr canceled his House testimony after clashing with Nadler over the hearing\u2019s format, particularly having staff lawyers question him in addition to committee members. Nadler said he would move forward with a contempt citation as soon as Monday.\n\n\u201cThe very system of government of the United States - the system of limited power, the system of not having a president as a dictator - is very much at stake,\u201d Nadler told reporters after a 15-minute committee session held in place of Barr\u2019s appearance.\n\nDemocrats have said they may issue a subpoena to try to force Barr to testify.\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\nBarr spent four hours before a Republican-led Senate committee on Wednesday defending his handling of Mueller\u2019s report and justifying Trump\u2019s actions.\n\nThe report detailed extensive contacts between Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and Moscow and the campaign\u2019s expectation that it would benefit from Russia\u2019s actions, which included hacking and propaganda to boost Trump and harm Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. The report also detailed a series of actions Trump took to try to impede the investigation.\n\nMueller, a former FBI director, concluded there was insufficient evidence to show a criminal conspiracy and opted not to make a conclusion on whether Trump committed obstruction of justice, but pointedly did not exonerate him. Barr has said he and Rod Rosenstein, the Justice Department\u2019s No. 2 official, then determined there was not enough evidence to charge Trump with obstruction."

There is no rule that provides for it.\u201d\n\nPrior case law underpins Congress\u2019 inherent contempt authority to jail people.\n\nWhile those cases did not explicitly deal with fines, some legal experts have interpreted the rulings to extend that power to Congress so they are on par with federal judges.\n\nA Supreme Court case in 1821 found that the \u201cconstitutional right of self-preservation\u201d for both courts and Congress were \u201canalogous,\u201d said Morton Rosenberg, a retired Congressional Research Service legal analyst.\n\nHe added that if Congress wants to impose fines on Barr, it would need to pass a resolution outlining a framework for doing so."

        "text": "Swarthmore Fraternities Disband Over Leaked Documents That Detailed Misogyny\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption AP AP\n\nThe only two fraternities at Swarthmore College have unanimously agreed to disband and give up their houses, ending a four-day sit-in and weeks of protest by outraged students after the publication of documents chronicling years of misogynist, racist and homophobic remarks, as well as jokes alluding to sexual assault by members.\n\nThe decisions to dissolve Phi Psi and Delta Upsilon were announced on Facebook on Tuesday night, after what both said were weeks of deliberation.\n\nThe controversy began last month, after campus publications Voices and The Phoenix released anonymously leaked internal documents from Phi Psi, dating from 2010 to 2016.\n\nThe trove of files included minutes, detailing graphic sexual encounters with female students, lists of fraternity hazing challenges, and intimate videos and photographs of women that appear to have been taken without their consent. (In most instances, the papers report, the women have their backs to the camera.) One entry refers to an alleged \"rape tunnel\" and a \"rape attic\" in one of the fraternity headquarters.\n\nCurrent members of both fraternities have noted that the actions described in the stories predate their association with the groups.\n\n\"The current members were in high school and middle school at the time of the writing of these documents,\" Phi Psi's statement reads. \"We were appalled and disgusted by the content of these minutes, which led us to question our affiliation with an organization whose former members could write such heinous statements. We cannot in good conscience be members of an organization with such a painful history.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, the wounds are too deep to repair, and the best course of action for all those involved is to disband the fraternity completely and give up the fraternity house,\" the statement said.\n\nSimilarly, Delta Upsilon said that after \"much discussion,\" members had unanimously agreed that \"disbanding our fraternity is in the best interest\" of the university.\n\n\"We hope that our former house will provide a space that is inclusive, safe, and promotes healing,\" the statement said.\n\nAs WHYY reporter Laura Benshoff wrote, pressure on university officials to terminate the two fraternity house leases began as early as April 3, when students created a social media page called \"Why Swarthmore's Fraternities Must Go.\"\n\nThe Tumblr page contained anonymous accounts of sexual assault, including some that allegedly occurred in what some students refer to as the \"rape attic,\" a second-story bedroom in one of the fraternity houses.\n\nDemonstrators called on the universities to rescind the fraternities' leases and turn the buildings over to groups that were disparaged by the fraternities.\n\nThe reaction on campus was one of jubilation.\n\n\"It was earsplitting. People were screaming and singing and laughing,\" Amal Haddad, a freshman and a member of a group called Organizing for Survivors, told NPR.\n\nHaddad is one of several student activists who organized the sit-in on the lawn and inside the stone house in the middle of campus that serves as Phi Psi's headquarters and is where dozens of students have said they experienced some type of unwanted touching, groping or sexual assault.\n\n\"There was also crying because a lot of work still has to be done to heal and transform. So much violence has happened here,\" she added.\n\nHaddad disputes the fraternities' assertion that the misogynist and sexually aggressive behaviors described in the 117-page document are a thing of the past, calling it \"nonsense.\"\n\n\"I know countless people who have been groped or assaulted this year alone,\" she said, adding the general attitude of fraternity members on campus is of \"complete entitlement.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption AP AP\n\nIn one entry from 2013, written shortly after a referendum to close the fraternities failed, said: \"Like is there a hotter organization on campus right now than the Phi brotherhood? ... We just took a nice sloppy poop on that referendum and we control the social scene.\"\n\nThe writer then urged the group to create a sex trafficking ring, adding, \"God that would be hot.\"\n\nAnother entry relays an anecdote about a Phi Psi member who took a walk around campus one night. \"On Saturday he decided to take one of these strolls and came across a chick passed out faced first in front of trotter. We weren't given any real details as what occurred after he found her.\"\n\nAfter reading through the documents, Haddad, who lives in the same hall as many fraternity members, said, \"It's clear they haven't changed.\"\n\nFrustration with the school's perceived inaction grew at the small liberal arts college after the documents were posted, and demonstrators began gathering in and around Phi Psi's building on Saturday. Four days of protests eventually prompted Swarthmore College President Valerie Smith to suspend fraternity activities pending the outcome of an external investigation.\n\nFollowing the fraternities' announcements on Tuesday, Smith issued a statement saying, \"We respect these students' decision to take this action, and we appreciate their strong condemnation of behavior described in the 2013-16 materials that have recently come to light.\"\n\nThe university plans to continue work by the Task Force on Student Social Events and Community Standards that began last spring, Smith said.\n\nLast year, Smith rejected the task force's recommendations on changes to Greek life on campus, including the suggestion to end leases to Phi Psi and Delta Upsilon.\n\n\"We have heard heartbreaking stories from students who feel unwelcome to the point of wanting to transfer out of our community,\" Smith said this week. \"Those stories have come from across the spectrum of our student body \u2014 from student protesters to fraternity members.\n\n\"Stories such as these reflect our failure to realize the values we so often espouse,\" she said, adding that there is \"no evidence that any current student participated in the behaviors documented in the unofficial 'minutes.' \""

        "text": "British Judge Sentences Julian Assange To 50 Weeks In Prison\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Jack Taylor/Getty Images Jack Taylor/Getty Images\n\nJulian Assange has been sentenced to 50 weeks in prison by a British judge.\n\nThe controversial founder of WikiLeaks was arrested in April after being pushed out of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he had been living since 2012, avoiding an international arrest warrant. That same day, he was convicted of jumping bail.\n\nJudge Deborah Taylor said Assange's time in the embassy had cost British taxpayers the equivalent of nearly $21 million, and that he had sought asylum in a \"deliberate attempt to delay justice.\"\n\nAssange offered a written apology in court, claiming that his actions were a response to terrifying circumstances. He said he had been effectively imprisoned in the embassy; two doctors also provided medical evidence of the mental and physical effects of being confined.\n\nThe judge was not swayed by the arguments. \"You were not living under prison conditions, and you could have left at any time to face due process with the rights and protections which the legal system in this country provides,\" she said.\n\nAssange's prison sentence fell two weeks short of the 12-month maximum.\n\nSupporters of the 47-year-old, who see him as a light shining truth on government abuses of power, shouted \"Free Julian Assange\" as the van that transported him left Southwark Crown Court.\n\nProtesters congregated nearby, criticizing the mainstream media and reportedly repeating the words \"Shame on you\" to the judge.\n\nAssange had been wanted for questioning about allegations of rape and sexual misconduct, and he had faced extradition to Sweden, but Ecuador granted him asylum. He has maintained that he is innocent.\n\nAssange is scheduled for another court hearing Thursday, as he faces the possibility of extradition to the United States. The U.S. Justice Department has accused him of helping former intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning in cracking a password stored on Department of Defense computers. Authorities said the trove of classified documents that WikiLeaks eventually published threatened U.S. national security.\n\nManning was convicted and served more than six years in prison. Her 35-year sentence was commuted by then-President Barack Obama.\n\nFederal investigators have also said that Assange and WikiLeaks played an integral role in the Russian attack on the 2016 presidential election. Prosecutors contend that Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU, gave Assange emails it had pilfered during that time.\n\nSwedish authorities dropped one case against him because it expired, but Assange may still face prosecution efforts in Sweden. After his arrest, more than 70 members of British Parliament signed a letter to support his extradition to Sweden if authorities there request it.\n\nWikiLeaks called Assange's sentence on Wednesday \"as shocking as it is vindictive.\" The organization said it has \"grave concerns as to whether he will receive a fair extradition hearing in the UK.\"\n\nWikiLeaks' Icelandic editor, Kristinn Hrafnsson, told reporters that Thursday's hearing would be the \"big fight,\" a battle over Assange's extradition to the United States.\n\n\"What is at stake there could be a question of life and death for Mr. Assange,\" he said. \"It is also a question of life and death for a major journalistic principle.\""

        "text": "Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet Launches 2020 White House Bid After Cancer Battle\nColorado Sen. Michael Bennet will join the growing field of Democrats seeking the 2020 presidential nomination after he was declared cancer-free.\n\n\"My plan is to run for president,\" Bennet said in an interview Thursday on CBS This Morning.\n\n\"I think this country faces two enormous challenges, among others. One is a lack of economic mobility and opportunity for most Americans, and the other is the need to restore integrity to our government,\" Bennet said. \"I think we need to do both of those things.\"\n\nThe 54-year-old announced last month that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer following a routine physical, delaying his planned White House announcement.\n\n\"The idea was to announce sometime in April,\" Bennet told The Colorado Independent. \"That was the plan. We hired some staff. We interviewed people for positions in New Hampshire and Iowa. And then I went for the physical. In my last physical, my PSA was high. They did a biopsy, and it was clear. But this time, it was not clear.\"\n\nHe said on CNN later that week that the diagnosis still didn't deter his 2020 plans.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to running in 2020,\" Bennet said. \"This obviously was unexpected. But we caught it early. It's something that I think we're going to be able to treat. And I don't think it should keep me off the trail.\"\n\nNow, following a successful surgery, Bennet is officially resuming efforts to win his party's nomination to try to defeat President Trump next year.\n\nBennet is the seventh senator to jump into the Democratic race and the second Coloradan, along with former Gov. John Hickenlooper, pitting Bennet against his onetime boss.\n\nBennet was plucked from the business world by Hickenlooper, a centrist and fellow alumnus of Wesleyan University, to be his chief of staff in the Denver mayor's office. Hickenlooper once told The Denver Post that Bennet was essentially \"the second mayor, the hidden mayor\" of the state capital.\n\nIn 2005, Bennet became the superintendent of the Denver Public Schools, helping to boost standards and competency rates during his four-year tenure. He was on President Barack Obama's shortlist to be education secretary when he was elected in 2008 but was ultimately passed over. However, another Cabinet choice would eventually pave Bennet's unlikely path to the Senate. When Colorado Sen. Ken Salazar was picked by Obama to lead the Interior Department, then-Gov. Bill Ritter surprised many people by choosing Bennet to replace him.\n\nThat relatively obscure profile Bennet had before coming to D.C. left Republicans hopeful they could knock him off in 2010, but he won a full term in what was otherwise a good year for the GOP. Bennet went on to chair the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee for the 2014 cycle and win re-election again in the purple state in 2016 by 6 percentage points. In the Senate, he has often worked across the aisle, including with his Colorado GOP colleague Cory Gardner, especially on energy and education issues.\n\nBennet's father, Douglas, was the president of NPR in the 1980s."

        "title": "Opioid Executive John Kapoor Found Guilty In Landmark Bribery Case",
        "text": "Opioid Executive John Kapoor Found Guilty In Landmark Bribery Case\n\nA jury in Boston has found onetime billionaire and drug company executive John Kapoor and his four co-defendants guilty of a racketeering conspiracy. The verdict came Wednesday after 15 days of deliberation.\n\nThe federal government accused Kapoor, the founder of Insys Therapeutics, and his co-defendants of running a nationwide bribery scheme. Between 2012 and 2015, Insys allegedly paid doctors to prescribe its potent opioid medication and then lied to insurance companies to ensure that the expensive fentanyl-based painkiller would be covered.\n\nKapoor is among the highest-ranking pharmaceutical executives to face trial amid a national opioid epidemic. By pursuing this case, the federal government was seen as sending a message that it is holding drug companies accountable for their role in the epidemic.\n\nThe guilty verdict could strengthen the cases against other pharmaceutical executives implicated in the opioid crisis.\n\n\"Today's convictions mark the first successful prosecution of top pharmaceutical executives for crimes related to the illicit marketing and prescribing of opioids,\" U.S. Attorney Andrew E. Lelling said in a statement. \"Just as we would street-level drug dealers, we will hold pharmaceutical executives responsible for fueling the opioid epidemic by recklessly and illegally distributing these drugs, especially while conspiring to commit racketeering along the way.\"\n\n\"This is a landmark prosecution that vindicated the public's interest in staunching the flow of opioids into our homes and streets,\" he continued.\n\nBrad Bailey, a criminal defense attorney in Boston and a former federal prosecutor, who has been following this case, said the 10-week trial represented a rare instance in which the federal government used criminal charges to go after corporate executives.\n\n\"That's always unusual. That's always an attention grabber,\" said Bailey. \"The big issue is the use of racketeering charges, which had been originally designed to go after the Mafia.\" By charging Kapoor and his co-defendants with racketeering, Bailey said, the federal government was essentially saying that the practices at Insys Therapeutics resembled organized crime.\n\nWhile the criminal charges set this case apart, the schemes detailed in this trial mirror the aggressive tactics that other pharmaceutical companies have allegedly used to push the sale of opioids.\n\nBribes and lies, or an unknowing executive?\n\nCalling 39 witnesses, federal prosecutors argued that Kapoor was motivated by money and willing to put patients' lives at stake to improve his bottom line. They depicted Insys Therapeutics as a struggling company under intense pressure from Kapoor to succeed.\n\nProsecutors outlined a two-step approach that Insys followed to boost sales of its opioid painkiller, Subsys: first, bribe doctors and, then, lie to insurance companies.\n\nInsys allegedly targeted doctors with a track record of liberally prescribing opioids, inviting them to participate in a \"speakers program.\" According to the government, doctors were paid handsomely even if nobody showed up for the lectures, but only if the doctors wrote a lot of prescriptions for Subsys. Often, prosecutors say, this meant patients who didn't need the medication were prescribed it anyway.\n\nInsys then allegedly set up a call center where drug company employees pretended to be from doctor's offices. Jurors heard phone calls in which Insys employees made up diagnoses to ensure that insurance companies covered Subsys, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars a month.\n\nThe defense attorneys for Kapoor and his four co-defendants called only a handful of witnesses. One was a patient who vouched for Subsys, saying it significantly reduced his pain after a car accident. The defense also emphasized Kapoor's personal story, arguing that he was motivated to create Subsys only after seeing his now-deceased wife struggle with severe pain.\n\nHowever, the crux of the defense's argument was that Kapoor was unaware of the illegal schemes. They blamed several former employees, in particular Alec Burlakoff, the former vice president of sales at Insys. Burlakoff and several other former Insys executives pleaded guilty and testified for the prosecution in the hopes of getting a more lenient sentence. The defense emphasized Burlakoff's history of lying and his hatred of Kapoor, which was captured on tape by federal investigators.\n\nIn closing arguments, defense attorneys highlighted contradictions in the testimony of several star government witnesses.\n\nWhile Kapoor has been on trial in Boston's federal courthouse, the company he founded has been facing financial troubles and management turmoil. Arizona-based Insys Therapeutics said in a statement that \"there is substantial risk surrounding our ability to continue ... primarily due to mounting legal costs and uncertain legal settlement exposures.\"\n\nLast year, the pharmaceutical company agreed to pay at least $150 million to end a Justice Department investigation into the bribery and kickback scheme. The insurance company Aetna, as well as patients, shareholders and state attorneys general, have also sued Insys.\n\nOn April 15, Insys replaced its CEO, Saeed Motahari, with the company's chief financial officer, Andrew Long. Since their high point in 2015, Insys shares have tumbled. Bloomberg News reported that shares had fallen 90 percent.\n\nBailey, the former federal prosecutor, says other pharmaceutical companies may see Insys' woes as a cautionary tale. However, some worry that the trial didn't strike at the root of the opioid crisis.\n\nLeo Beletsky, a professor of law and health sciences at Northeastern University, says, \"A lot of what pharmaceutical companies did in the context of the opioid crisis that we are dealing with now was not, in fact, illegal. It was maybe unethical, but it was not illegal.\"\n\nWhile bribing doctors to write prescriptions and fabricating diagnoses is illegal, paying physicians to promote products to their peers is a common practice in the pharmaceutical industry. Off-label prescribing is also legal and common, although sales representatives are not technically supposed to advocate for off-label uses of a medication.\n\nBeletsky says by focusing on individuals and their illegal schemes, this trial overlooked broader issues, such as drug companies legally spending billions of dollars to maximize the use of their medications.\n\nFor Beletsky, the answer lies in regulation. \"We need to think much more deeply about how we regulate the pharmaceutical industry and how we prevent these kinds of practices from occurring in the first place,\" says Beletsky.\n\nHowever, experts say, there are currently no major legislative efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical industry. For now, the pushback against marketing strategies that allegedly fueled the opioid crisis remains in the courts."

        "text": "A woman described in police documents as a \u201cvery close friend\u201d of the mother of Andrew \u201cAJ\u201d Freund said Thursday she previously knew nothing about the tragic circumstances surrounding the 5-year-old Crystal Lake boy\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cIf I would have known what I know now I would have done a heck of a lot more,\u201d the friend told the Tribune.\n\nThe woman\u2019s name appeared in a police affidavit describing the investigation that led to AJ\u2019s parents being charged in his death. Texts sent between the woman and JoAnn Cunningham, the boy\u2019s mother, are referenced in the document.\n\nThe woman said Thursday she was in the family\u2019s home when a 911 call was made April 18 reporting AJ missing. But the woman said the call was made about a half-hour after she urged Cunningham and the boy\u2019s father to report his disappearance. The woman said she \u201cflew over there\u201d to the Crystal Lake home on that day after being told by Cunningham that AJ could not be found.\n\nThe woman, who the Tribune is not naming because she said she has received death threats after the affidavit with her name appeared online, said she helped search for the boy in the home and while doing so heard AJ\u2019s father, Andrew Freund, make the 911 call. As they searched, Cunningham was saying, \u201cI want my kid back,\u201d according to the woman. The woman also searched nearby stores.\n\nThat was three days after authorities allege that Cunningham and Freund killed the boy. Authorities say Freund later buried his body is a shallow grave near Woodstock, where he was found April 24.\n\nThe parents were charged with AJ\u2019s killing, as well as aggravated battery, aggravated domestic battery, failure to report a missing child and, in Freund\u2019s case, concealment of a homicide. Cunningham also was charged with an aggravated battery related to a video found on her phone from March 4.\n\nDespite police describing her in the affidavit as being a close friend to Cunningham, the woman said they \u201cwere not close.\u201d\n\nIn the affidavit, police said cellphone records indicate that Cunningham texted her friend about AJ\u2019s health on April 16 \u2014 the day after AJ is alleged to have been killed. According to the affidavit, Cunningham \u201ccomplained about AJ as not getting better from what she had previously self-diagnosed or likened to oppositional defiance disorder (ODD).\u201d\n\nAccording to the affidavit, many text messages between the women were deleted from Cunningham\u2019s phone but were found on her friend\u2019s, including the April 16 text.\n\nStanding in her garage Thursday at her suburban home, the woman was trembling and in tears. She told the Tribune that their friendship has lasted about two or three years and has consisted mostly of texting each other.\n\nAJ Freund saga: The family's interactions with DCFS and how the tragedy unfolded \u00bb\n\nThe friend said Cunningham felt comfortable talking to her about AJ\u2019s supposed ODD because her own son has ODD.\n\nShe said when she visited, the house was often cluttered but not as bad as recent reports have indicated.\n\nShe said they had gone to the beach together about two years ago with family members and she did not see any bruises on AJ or his younger brother or anything out of sorts with their relationship. She did recall seeing scars on AJ\u2019s face about a year ago that she said Cunningham said was the result of AJ spilling boiling water on himself.\n\nThe Illinois Department of Children and Family Services has said it has had a history of dealing with the family since AJ was born with opiates in his system.\n\nThe woman said she fears for her family\u2019s safety and her own health because of her association with Cunningham. She said she and her family have been harassed and have received death threats.\n\n\u201cLeave me alone, realize I am not part of this,\u201d she begged of those she said were harassing her.\n\nA year before AJ Freund died, a McHenry County prosecutor raised concerns about how DCFS handled cases in his county \u00bb\n\nAt one point while speaking to a reporter Thursday, she collapsed to the ground, apparently from stress. But neighbors later said she was OK.\n\n\u201cI just want this to be over,\u201d she said.\n\nThe woman said she wants people to know that she willingly turned over her cellphone to authorities and has been cooperating all along and, like everyone else, did not know what truly had happened to AJ.\n\n\u201cPeople are assuming I knew everything,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I knew, why would I give the FBI my cellphone?\u201d\n\nBefore knowing AJ\u2019s fate and while he was still reported as missing, the friend said Cunningham asked her to drive her to a custody hearing April 23 concerning AJ\u2019s younger brother.\n\nCunningham would remain at the courthouse that night until 2:30 a.m. April 24.\n\n\u201cThey told (me) they were keeping her for questioning and I left,\u201d the friend said.\n\nLater that morning, Freund led authorities to the body. He and Cunningham were arrested and charged in the death of their son.\n\nSince her arrest the friend said Cunningham has been calling her from jail and she has blocked her calls.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not OK,\u201d the friend said, sobbing. \u201cHe\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\n"

Drew said he helped AJ out of the shower after he\u2019d been there approximately 20 minutes, and put AJ to bed \u2018cold, wet, and naked.\u2019\n\n\u201cDrew said Joann got up and checked on AJ and that was when she got Drew and used Drew\u2019s phone to search for child cpr. Drew advised at some point that he believed AJ had died. Drew said the next day he took AJ\u2019s body to the basement and stored him in a tote. He said on the night of 4/17/19 he placed Andrew inside of several trash bags, placed the body in the trunk of his car, and drove him to an area in Woodstock. Drew said he dug a shallow grave for AJ, placed him in it, covered it with straw, and left.\u201d\n\nFreund took police to the grave on a vacant property near Woodstock, where they found AJ\u2019s body, the documents alleged.\n\nAn autopsy determined that AJ died from blunt force trauma to his head.\n\nThe documents said that police found the family home in \u201choarder\u201d condition. Freund\u2019s cellphone contained a photo of a handwritten shopping list containing duct tape, plastic gloves, air freshener and bleach, and at least some of those items were found at the house.\n\nAJ\u2019s visitation is set for 1-8 p.m. Friday at Davenport Family Funeral Home in Crystal Lake. Memorial services will be private.\n\nIn his request for a search warrant, Maldonado added many details about the evidence investigators found and what Freund told him.\n\nMaldonado said police had made numerous visits to the house at 94 Dole Ave., mostly for domestic violence and well-being checks. He described the parents as \u201cknown and self-admitted prior narcotics abusers.\u201d\n\nWhile police questioned him for several hours on April 18, Freund said the night before AJ allegedly went missing, Freund \u201chung out\u201d with his sons before going to a Jewel grocery store, according to Maldonado.\n\nFreund said he and Cunningham put AJ to bed after brushing teeth, washing hands and saying prayers. The next morning, Freund went to a doctor\u2019s appointment at 6:30 a.m. A woman who checked him out said he took a receipt and said, \u201cThe lawyer in me thinks I need a paper trail.\u201d\n\nWhen Freund told Crystal Lake police Detective David Eitel about the visit, he told the detective he should make a copy of Freund\u2019s appointment card and include it with the case, which Eitel considered suspicious.\n\nFreund said Cunningham believed AJ had \u201coppositional defiance disorder,\u201d or ODD, and gave a glimpse of the interactions within the family.\n\n\u201cDrew explained AJ thinks of himself as the leader of the home and therefore he is defiant to his parents, lies, disobeys, and thinks things should go his way. Drew explained that, yes, he and Joann lock AJ in his room at night because sometimes he gets out throughout the house. Drew also said sometimes AJ had disciplinary timeouts of a whole afternoon locked in his bedroom, once for 5 hours.\n\n\u201cDrew explained that a short time ago Joann had asked AJ to wash dishes and that AJ did not do a very good job, despite having been instructed the proper way to do dishes. Drew said this minor infraction was compounded by the fact that AJ then lied about some aspect of his dish-washing performance."

        "title": "Judge grows testy at call he recuse himself from deciding on special prosecutor in Jussie Smollett case",
        "text": "A hearing on a request for a special prosecutor in the Jussie Smollett case quickly switched its focus Thursday from the \u201cEmpire\u201d actor to the judge on the bench.\n\nThe proceedings grew unexpectedly heated when Sheila O\u2019Brien, a retired appellate judge pushing for the special prosecutor, filed last-minute paperwork suggesting that Cook County Judge LeRoy Martin Jr. recuse himself from deciding the issue because his son has worked as a county prosecutor since last year.\n\nO\u2019Brien contended that would put Martin in a precarious position if State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx was called as a witness in the proceedings.\n\nColumn: If it pleases the court: Watch Jussie Smollett in an Obama White House video \u00bb\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to decide whether the state\u2019s attorney, your son\u2019s boss, is telling the truth,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cYour son\u2019s career is tied to the potential witness\u2019 career.\u201d\n\nMartin, who at times appeared to barely conceal his frustration with O\u2019Brien\u2019s argument despite keeping a smile on his face, postponed the hearing until next week to give him time to consider the request for him to step aside. He made it clear, though, he thought O\u2019Brien\u2019s request had taken a personal turn he didn\u2019t appreciate.\n\n\u201cNever before has this issue come up regarding this, considering the fact that I sit in judgment of cases every day involving the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office,\u201d he said. \u201cIt troubles me that we\u2019re having this discussion about my family member because bringing one\u2019s family into these kinds of circumstances is troubling.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien said she only realized that the younger Martin\u2019s connection to the prosecutors\u2019 office would become an issue Wednesday night after news media reports about his employment.\n\nMartin, the presiding judge of the Circuit Court\u2019s Criminal Division, also appeared frustrated that O\u2019Brien expected him to decide on the matter at the last minute. That led to a testy exchange between the two.\n\n\u201cYou stepped up and 10 minutes ago you file-stamped this and dropped this on my desk, and (you) tell me that I need to decide this issue that you\u2019ve just made an issue a few moments ago,\u201d he said. \u201cLike you, I wasn\u2019t aware of --\u201d\n\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t aware your son was a state\u2019s attorney?\u201d O\u2019Brien interrupted.\n\n\u201cOnly my wife can complete my sentences,\u201d Martin shot back to scattered applause from the courtroom gallery.\n\nJussie Smollett seeks to block his appearance in court \u00bb\n\nProsecutors from Foxx\u2019s office also slammed O\u2019Brien\u2019s request for Martin to step aside, noting that his son had nothing to do with the Smollett case \u2014 and doesn\u2019t even practice at the Leighton Criminal Court Building, where Martin works. Martin\u2019s son, LeRoy III, who has been with the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office since April 2018, works as a prosecutor in the juvenile court.\n\nAssistant State\u2019s Attorney Mark Rotert argued that O\u2019Brien\u2019s bid to force Martin out was only misdirection because her petition for a special prosecutor is deeply flawed and should be tossed out.\n\nIllinois statute \u201cclearly slam-dunks her argument. She cannot win,\u201d Rotert said. \u201cBecause she cannot win, she comes in and misdirects with other issues. \u2026 When we get to the heart of this matter ultimately, we will find there\u2019s no there there.\u201d\n\nJussie Smollett's character on 'Empire' still in limbo \u00bb\n\nWhen prosecutors and Martin repeatedly raised the point that Martin regularly hears cases involving the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office, O\u2019Brien said that might signal a broader problem.\n\n\u201cMaybe there should be a hard look about whether people who have relatives in the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office should be judges on these cases,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s an appearance of impropriety.\u201d\n\nSteven Lubet, a professor at Northwestern University\u2019s Pritzker School of Law who has written extensively on judicial ethics, said Martin\u2019s son is too far removed from the Smollett case for his connection to cause an ethical concern.\n\n\u201cFamily relationships can require the disqualification of a judge, but typically it\u2019s because the relative is actually involved in the case before the court,\u201d he said. \u201c \u2026 This is just too remote to require disqualification.\u201d\n\nKim Foxx opposes appointing special prosecutor \u00bb\n\nO\u2019Brien filed the petition the week after Foxx\u2019s office made the surprise decision to drop all charges against Smollett just weeks after indicting him on 16 counts of disorderly conduct alleging he staged an attack on himself.\n\nSmollett, who is African-American and openly gay, found himself at the center of an international media firestorm after he reported in late January being the victim of an attack by two people shouting racist and homophobic slurs.\n\nBut he was charged after Chicago police determined that Smollett had agreed to pay $3,500 to two brothers he knew to stage the attack.\n\nFoxx has faced fierce criticism over her office\u2019s abrupt dismissal of the charges, including calls for her resignation by the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police. The county inspector general\u2019s office is investigating the matter at Foxx\u2019s request.\n\nIn her petition, O\u2019Brien highlighted how Foxx said she recused herself in the early stages of the investigation \u2014 only to claim recently that it was not a recusal \u201cin the legal sense\u201d that would have required the entire office to withdraw from the prosecution.\n\nO\u2019Brien alleged that Foxx\u2019s actions created \u201ca perception that justice was not served here, that Mr. Smollett received special treatment.\u201d\n\nBoth county prosecutors and Smollett\u2019s attorneys have said the petition is legally flawed and that the appointment of a special prosecutor is unnecessary because of the review already undertaken by the IG\u2019s office.\n\n"

        "title": "On farewell tour, Rahm Emanuel responds to 'Mayor 1 percent' criticism: 'I\u2019m proud that we have a thriving, successful central business district'",
        "text": "Mayor Rahm Emanuel used a downtown speech on his farewell tour Thursday to hit back at critics and try to shore up his legacy on his way out the door.\n\nSpeaking to a City Club of Chicago luncheon packed with officials from his administration, city contractors and downtown business types, Emanuel acknowledged he can rub people wrong but said his headstrong impatience is sometimes needed to get results. \u201cI am who I am,\u201d said Emanuel, a more unrepentant stance than when he donned a fuzzy sweater during a 2015 re-election ad and apologized for unspecified mistakes.\n\nWhile his decision to close dozens of Chicago public schools in his first term, many in African-American neighborhoods, and to oversee the first Chicago Teachers Union strike in decades in 2012 are often pointed to as prime examples of his failure to collaborate and listen to the needs of residents, Emanuel tried to frame his educational achievements as proof he takes such concerns to heart.\n\n\u201cDuring the campaign, I heard from parents all the time, \u2018How come those kids on the North Side get full-day kindergarten and ours don\u2019t?\u2019 Or the parents that said to me, \u2018How come our kids don\u2019t get recess and arts, and there\u2019s no time in the day and we only get 20 minutes for reading?\u2019 \u201d Emanuel said. \u201cI heard their voices. I also had the political courage and the will to take those voices to the table.\u201d\n\nAnd he took his customary opportunity to hold up his accomplishments next to those of his predecessor, Mayor Richard M. Daley, as usual without naming Daley. Emanuel\u2019s success in getting union contracts with longer school days stands in contrast to Daley\u2019s failure to achieve that, he said.\n\n\u201cBesides meeting and listening, you have to learn,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd learning means, my predecessor, in both the \u201903 and \u201907 contracts, tried to get a full school day, and didn\u2019t. Tried.\u201d\n\nCSO, Lucas museum, the Riverwalk: Rahm Emanuel talks arts in Chicago, what he's most proud of \u2014 and regrets \u00bb\n\nEmanuel in recent weeks has been making his case for his two terms as he prepares to hand the keys to the fifth-floor office at City Hall to Lori Lightfoot on May 20.\n\nWBBM-AM political editor Craig Dellimore interviewed Emanuel at the luncheon, a departure from the usual City Club format where speakers address the crowd then take questions submitted by the audience.\n\nDellimore also pressed Emanuel on the \u201cMayor 1 percent\u201d tag that has dogged him for years, a nickname critics use to tie him to wealthy supporters and downtown development they say he favors at the expense of struggling outlying neighborhoods.\n\nEmanuel first responded by taking a swipe at wealthy Blackhawks and United Center owner Rocky Wirtz, who has publicly ripped Emanuel for raising entertainment taxes at big venues such as the United Center: \u201cGo ask Rocky Wirtz what he thinks about being part of the 1 percent.\u201d\n\nWhen Dellimore said the criticism comes from poor and working-class neighborhoods that feel like they\u2019ve been left behind while the Loop and adjoining neighborhoods have boomed under Emanuel, the mayor changed tacks. He defended investments downtown.\n\n\u201cYou name me one world-class city in the world with a decaying central business district,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cName one. They don\u2019t exist. I\u2019m proud that we have a thriving, successful central business district that gives us the revenue to also fund from 14 to 33,000 kids in summer jobs.\u201d\n\nAnd Emanuel said he has worked to fix neighborhood problems he inherited, asking West Side Ald. Michael Scott Jr., 24th, whether difficulties in his part of the city began when Emanuel took office. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest, guys, did the problems on the South and West sides start in 2011? Ald. Scott?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope,\u201d Scott said from his seat in the crowd.\n\n\u201cOK, thank you,\u201d Emanuel continued. \u201cThey didn\u2019t start then. The real question is, did we start to put the resources (in those neighborhoods)?\u201d\n\nOn political corruption that has long been part of the city\u2019s reputation, Emanuel ticked off a laundry list of scandals in City Hall in Baltimore and elsewhere to make the case Chicago really isn\u2019t that bad, relatively speaking.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cheap story for you all to say \u2018Chicago\u2019s the most corrupt.\u2019 Really? There\u2019s a mayor stepping down today in another city. There\u2019s a speaker in another state and a governor in trouble. There\u2019s another state where the governor\u2019s chief of staff is in trouble. Come on. Has Chicago got a long way to go? You don\u2019t need me to sit here and tell you that. But have we made significant improvements to where we were 20, 30, 40 years ago? Yes.\u201d\n\n"

        "text": "The young fans who lifted Austin Jones to internet stardom were devout in their affection, the way only teenage girls can be.\n\nCrowds would swarm the singer after his shows, and his admirers \u2014 many connecting to songs that hinted at Jones\u2019 own traumatic history \u2014 flooded him with messages confiding in him about their own abuse and depression.\n\nIt was among those devoted fans that Jones found his victims, coercing underage girls to perform sexually explicit dances during live online chats by promising modeling opportunities, Instagram stardom and his valuable attention.\n\n\u201cohmygoodness that\u2019s amazing!!\u201d one victim responded when Jones told her she had \u201ca lot of modeling potential,\u201d according to prosecutors.\n\nOn Friday, the U.S. attorney\u2019s office will seek an 11-year prison sentence for Jones, 26, in Chicago\u2019s federal court following his guilty plea in February to child pornography charges. The resident of west suburban Bloomingdale admitted he persuaded six underage girls \u2014 14 to 15 at the time \u2014 to make sexually explicit videos for him while attempting to coerce as many as 30 others as well.\n\n\u201cHe preyed on their youth, their vulnerabilities and most glaringly, their adoration of him, and he did it over and over again,\u201d prosecutors said in a court filing last week. \u201cHe coached the girls on what to wear, what to say, how to dance and what to do in the videos.\u201d\n\nYouTube star Austin Jones pleads guilty to coercing underage girls to send him sexually explicit videos \u00bb\n\nIn asking for leniency, Jones\u2019 attorneys emphasized his own history as a victim, arguing his actions cannot be fully understood outside the context of a childhood \u201cmarred with abuse, pain, loss and death.\u201d\n\nThe defense seeks the minimum possible sentence of five years in prison in a court filing that lays out in graphic terms Jones\u2019 complicated past, including allegations of years of childhood sexual abuse at the hands of his alcoholic, cocaine-abusing father, now deceased, as well as the death of his sister at a young age.\n\n\u201cThere can be no question that the systematic devastation of Mr. Jones\u2019 psyche at the hands of his father at such an impressionable age helped create the conditions in which Mr. Jones acted in the manner that he did,\u201d wrote attorneys Terrence LeFevour and David Gaeger.\n\nManipulated vulnerable fans\n\nJones rose to fame in a particularly 21st-century fashion, attracting online fans \u2014 many on YouTube \u2014 with music he mostly recorded in his living room and promoted on social media. At the height of his popularity, he had hundred of thousands of followers and toured around the world.\n\nBut his superstar status crumbled after authorities unearthed dozens of sexually explicit online chats with underage girls, some lasting hours. He would often coax them to take off their clothes and dance suggestively on video, sometimes instructing them to talk about their young age as they performed.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s your line \u2014 hey Austin, I\u2019m only 14 \u2014 Say that 4 times during the video got it?!\u201d Jones told one girl, according to the recent prosecution filing.\n\n\u201cKk!!\u201d she responded. \u201cWhile each video sends, I just sit here listening to you on my Spotify.\u201d\n\n'Wait . . . you're 14?': Austin Jones had YouTube fame, 40 million page views, adoring fans and a shocking secret. \u00bb\n\nJones was arrested at O\u2019Hare International Airport in June 2017 as he returned on a flight from performing in Poland. In a recorded confession, he admitted soliciting explicit videos from his underage fans.\n\nIf the girls were reticent to do what he wanted, Jones told authorities, he would try to make them feel guilty and \u201cmanipulate a way so that they don\u2019t feel the need to stop,\u201d according to Assistant U.S. Attorney Katherine Neff Welsh.\n\nIn one example in prosecutors\u2019 filing, Jones was quoted as asking one victim if she felt \u201cspecial\u201d because \u201cout of all my fans, I picked you for this opportunity?\u201d\n\nThe victim responded by saying she felt as if she was \u201cdreaming,\u201d prosecutors said.\n\nAnother victim who was dancing for Jones said she might have to finish the next day \u201cbecause I have school in the morning,\u201d according to prosecutors.\n\nJones responded that they would do five more videos, prompting the girl to ask, \u201ctomorrow, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, right now. Then we do the rest tomorrow,\u201d prosecutors quoted Jones as saying. \u201cI\u2019m taking a huge chance on you. And you don\u2019t even seem like you want it.\u201d\n\nLyrics expose depth of pain\n\nJones\u2019 attorneys said he has taken responsibility for his actions, expressed profound remorse, undertaken therapy to try to deal with his demons and diligently obeyed the strict rules of his release on house arrest.\n\nThe defense centers much of its argument for mercy on Jones\u2019 own history as an alleged victim of abuse, saying it provides the proper context for his later misconduct.\n\nIn the months after his arrest, Jones alleged that his father repeatedly molested him between the ages of 6 and 10, according to the defense filing. The ensuing \u201cemotional trauma and chaos \u2026 has consumed his life,\u201d they wrote, leading to severe depression, low self-esteem, sexual dysfunction and difficulty sleeping since the age of 11.\n\n\u201cOverwhelmed socially, emotionally and academically, it was often a struggle just to get out of bed\u201d during his final two years of high school, his attorneys wrote in their sentencing memo.\n\nHis music provided an outlet for his anxiety and depression, Jones said, and his fan base responded in kind, telling him about their own experiences with self-harm and abuse.\n\n\u201cHis lyrics expose the depth of his pain and extent of his struggles,\u201d his attorneys wrote. \u201cListening to his music you can hear his cries for help and his desperate self-yearning to understand what was wrong with him. His song titled, \u2018Damaged Goods,\u2019 says it all.\u201d\n\nProsecutors acknowledged that Jones\u2019 experiences affected his mental health but noted that works both ways: having been abused, he still \u201cinflicted the same harms upon a new generation of victims\u201d despite having \u201ca unique appreciation\u201d for the damage he would cause, they said.\n\nAnd Jones knew just how to manipulate his vulnerable fans into performing the lewd acts for him, preying on their naivete and their own mental health issues or insecurities, prosecutors said."

        "text": "When the final whistle blows this weekend for workers on the third shift at the Belvidere Assembly Plant near Rockford, the nearly 1,400 members of \u201cC Crew\u201d will punch out for the last time, downsized out of a job because of slowing demand for the plant\u2019s only product \u2014 the Jeep Cherokee.\n\nIt is a straightforward business decision for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, which is scaling back to a traditional two-shift schedule at the plant amid softening sales and a glut of competitors.\n\nBut for residents of Belvidere, a small river city situated amid sprawling cornfields about 75 miles northwest of Chicago, Monday will be anything but business as usual.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d said Mike Dovey, 57, of Poplar Grove, whose two years at the plant end Saturday. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty. You don\u2019t have a job, you\u2019ve still got to pay all your bills.\u201d\n\nDovey was among the 1,371 least-tenured union workers at the plant who received notice from Fiat Chrysler in February that the third crew \u2014 and their jobs \u2014 would be eliminated in May. In addition, hundreds of employees at nearby suppliers like Syncreon and Android have been permanently laid off as well, according to state filings.\n\nThe anxiety among residents here is palpable, even as the plant, which employed 5,464 at the start of 2019, will likely remain the region\u2019s largest employer. Fiat Chrysler declined to say what the actual Belvidere employee count will be after the layoffs, but it\u2019s not lost on people here that the automaker is investing billions in new production capacity elsewhere.\n\nHundreds of displaced Chrysler workers attended a recent UAW Local 1268 severance meeting at the Belvidere community center, filing through a gray rain to face a grim choice: They have until May 13 to decide if they want temporary positions at the Belvidere plant, and whether to sign up for full-time openings down the road at either their home plant or Chrysler facilities in other markets such as Detroit and Toledo, Ohio.\n\nThe laid-off autoworkers are also eligible to receive $13,000 worth of federally funded job training if they want to change careers.\n\nDovey, who attended the meeting, said he was considering going back to school to become either a truck driver or a correctional officer, but had no interest in relocating for Chrysler. He already moved, from Boston, 17 years ago.\n\n\u201cI own a home. Now I\u2019ve got to sell my house, move all my stuff,\u201d he said, before adding, \u201cWhy do I want move there?\u201d\n\nBrian Pasch, 33, of Rockford, who also attended the UAW information session, worked in the chassis department at Belvidere for two years, putting seats in the cars. He previously worked for a supplier to the plant.\n\nWhile the layoff put plans to buy a house for his wife and stepson on hold, Pasch said he would be willing to take temporary work at the Belvidere plant on the two shifts that will remain, or relocate to Chrysler plants in Toledo or Detroit if he could land full-time work.\n\nHe\u2019s not being fussy.\n\n\u201cThis is all I know, so whatever they offer me, I\u2019ll take,\u201d Pasch said.\n\nBrian Cassella/Chicago Tribune Mike Dovey, center, talks to prospective employers during a job fair May 1, 2019, at the UAW Hall in Belvidere, Ill.

One of them features Jeanne Gang, a native daughter whose architecture firm is reshaping Chicago\u2019s skyline.\n\nFor more than half a century, Belvidere has been an auto town, its fortunes inextricably tied to the Chrysler auto plant, which brought hope, jobs and a succession of new car models \u2014 some more popular than others.\n\nBrian Cassella/Chicago Tribune A Plymouth Fury II, the first car to roll off the line at the Chrysler plant in 1965, is on display at the Boone County Museum of History in Belvidere. A Plymouth Fury II, the first car to roll off the line at the Chrysler plant in 1965, is on display at the Boone County Museum of History in Belvidere. (Brian Cassella/Chicago Tribune)\n\nThe first car that rolled off the line on July 7, 1965, was a snazzy, white, four-door Plymouth Fury II sedan, which is proudly displayed at the Boone County Museum of History in downtown Belvidere. The original sticker remains affixed to the window: The car had a base price of $2,684. Extras, like an AM radio ($57.35), an electric clock ($15.30) and the always dubious undercoating ($15.40), brought the total to $3,206.90.\n\nOver the years, the plant was retooled several times, and made everything from the compact Dodge Omni to the land-yacht Chrysler New Yorker. All the while, it was a survivor. During Chrysler\u2019s painful bankruptcy in 2009, the plant was down to 200 employees before Fiat and a government bailout rescued it and the company.\n\nBy 2012, the plant had new life. Fiat Chrysler\u2019s dynamic chairman, Sergio Marchionne, visited the plant, fresh off a $700 million investment to gear up for production of the Dodge Dart. To an exuberant crowd standing amid the retooled assembly lines, he announced that the plant would add a third shift and 1,800 workers.\n\nAs recently as 2017, the plant\u2019s future seemed secure when it became the exclusive home for the Jeep Cherokee, the sweet spot in an auto industry where SUVs have supplanted cars in many family garages. Last year, when GM announced it would close plants because of flagging sedan sales, Belvidere was humming along, producing nearly 270,000 Jeep Cherokees \u2014 up 27 percent from 2017.\n\nBrian Cassella/Chicago Tribune Fiat Chrysler's Belvidere Assembly Plant is seen May 1, 2019. Fiat Chrysler's Belvidere Assembly Plant is seen May 1, 2019. (Brian Cassella/Chicago Tribune)\n\nShifting winds\n\nNow Fiat Chrysler is applying the brakes on Cherokee production and eliminating the third shift at Belvidere. Fiat Chrysler has given no indication of further cutbacks, but there are reasons for concern, according to Michelle Krebs, a Detroit-based analyst for Autotrader.\n\n\u201cThe third shift is always the first to go when sales begin slumping,\u201d Krebs said.\n\nFiat Chrysler sales fell 3.2 percent in the first quarter of 2019, outpacing the 2.5 percent year-over-year decline across the broader auto industry, according to Edmunds.\n\nBut beyond industry trends, Krebs said the Belvidere plant faces an uphill climb with its reliance on the Jeep Cherokee, an older nameplate relaunched as an all-new model in 2013.\n\nA redesigned Cherokee won\u2019t arrive until 2022, according to Fiat Chrysler spokeswoman Jodi Tinson.\n\nA bigger concern for Belvidere\u2019s future may be something it cannot control: its location. While Fiat Chrysler is laying off employees in Illinois, it announced plans to build a new $4.5 billion assembly plant in Detroit, and to retool five existing facilities in Michigan, creating nearly 6,500 jobs.\n\n\u201cOne disadvantage a plant like Belvidere has is it\u2019s kind of out of the way from all the other plants,\u201d Krebs said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the things considered when they decide where to put products into plants.\u201d\n\nKrebs pointed to location as a key reason GM pulled the plug on its plant in Janesville, Wis., during the Great Recession in December 2008. That decision, once unthinkable, ended a 90-year run for the auto plant, displacing 1,200 remaining workers."

        "text": "\nNewsweek and a public ethics watchdog group have just exposed Ivanka Trump\u2019s secretive use of personal email to conduct official business in the White House.\n\nThe Trump campaign and Republican party spent literally two entire years propagandizing their voters about the terrors of Hillary Clinton legal use of private email systems, yet this marks the second private email scandal in as many days for President\u2019s two senior advisors bratty children, whom he nepotistically hired to run America.\n\nWatchdog group American Oversight found the emails by using a Freedom of Information Act request and it turns out that for the purpose of secretly emailing Trump\u2019s former donors about official business, Ivanka uses her married name, Kushner. Newsweek reports:\n\nIvanka Trump, the first daughter and adviser to the president, used a personal email address to communicate with a government official after her father took office, according to documents that the nonprofit American Oversight obtained through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and shared exclusively with Newsweek. The documents show that on February 28, Trump\u2014identifying herself as Ivanka Kushner\u2014emailed Linda McMahon, the administrator of the United States Small Business Administration, from a personal domain. At the time, Trump was operating inside the White House in a nonofficial capacity. She wrote that she wanted McMahon\u2019s agency and her staff to \u201cexplore opportunities to collaborate\u201d on issues related to \u201cwomen\u2019s entrepreneurship.\u201d She copied on the correspondence the government email addresses of two other federal employees, Dina Powell and Julie Radford.\n\nWhen Clinton was Secretary of State, her private email server was allowed, but the Obama Administration ended the practice after she left office.\n\nMeanwhile, Ivanka Trump advised her daddy, the racist President, from virtually day one in the White House and as a member of the First Family was entitled to an official email account right away. She met Canadian President Justin Trudeau and attended other White House events while scribbling away secret notes to the taxpayers\u2019 public servants her daddy\u2019s cronies.\n\nIronically, her husband Jared Kushner was also caught using a private email account just this weekend, which he used to secretly communicate with Steve Bannon, Reince Priebus and Gary Cohn amongst others, after the election and early in the Administration.\n\nNewsweek has consistently been a leader in seeking out the secretive private email accounts our (heretofore all) Republican elected officials are abusing in the White House.\n\nThey caught the Bush Administration deleting evidence of their war crimes and must more, when they exposed 22 million emails were deleted, including many about their big lies deployed to urge America into a perpetual war in Iraq.\n\nInfamous Republican strategist Karl \u201cBush\u2019s Brain\u201d Rove used private email accounts from the Republican National Committee to run his culture wars from the White House in complete secret.\n\nThis past December, one of their reports busted the Trump transition team working directly with the very same Republican National Committee to create a secret email system to avoid detection, which they shut down after the news broke.\n\nToday\u2019s news that Ivanka Trump is abusing the use of private email \u2013 long after the practice has been banned in the executive branch \u2013 shows utter contempt for the American people and is part of the Trump regime\u2019s earnest attempts to be the least transparent administration in American history.\n\nIf not for courageous government watchdogs like American Oversight \u2013 who Rachel Maddow featured on MSNBC just two weeks ago \u2013 we would never know about the Executive Branch\u2019s stunning abuse of power and secrecy to cover it all up.\n"

        "text": "\nMichael Jordon, whom many consider the greatest athlete ever to play professional basketball, has a long history of being reticent to discuss politics or state political positions.\n\nJordon once, according to reports that were never verified, refused to endorse a black candidate in a North Carolina Senate race against a long time racist, Jesse Helms, with the quip: \u201cRepublicans buy sneakers too.\u201d\n\nThese days in his retirement Jordon is the managing partner of the Charlotte Hornets basketball team \u2013 in North Carolina, where the far right wing controls most political offices \u2013 and he has once again tried to stay away from sensitive political issues.\n\nUntil now.\n\nThis weekend, even Jordon spoke out after President Trump at a rally in Alabama on Friday that owners of NFL teams should take action against player\u2019s peaceful protests \u2013 including taking a knee when the national anthem is played \u2013 by having the team owner say, \u201cGet that son of a bitch off the field right now. He\u2019s fire. He\u2019s fired.\u201d\n\nTrump may be recycling his line from his days on The Apprentice, but Jordon made clear that this time the president is not the boss.\n\nOn Sunday evening, Jordon told the Charlotte Observer newspaper that athletes who protest, taking a knee or otherwise carrying out peaceful protests, should not be \u201cdemonized.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the fundamental rights this country is founded on was freedom of speech,\u201d said Jordon, \u201cand we have a long tradition of nonviolent, peaceful protest. Those who exercise the right to peacefully express themselves should not be demonized or ostracized.\u201d \u201cAt a time of increasing divisiveness and hate in this country,\u201d added Jordon, \u201cwe should be looking for ways to work together and support each other and not create more division.\u201d \u201cI support Commissioner Adam Silver, the NBA, its players and all those who wish to exercise their right to free speech,\u201d concluded Jordon.\n\nJordon\u2019s reference to the professional basketball league, which obviously also applied to pro football, put him on record along with other NBA team owners, players, and even the league\u2019s commissioner, as rejecting Trump\u2019s call to treat protesters as pariahs.\n\nThe NBA was drawn into Trump\u2019s tirade last week after Golden State Warriors superstar Stephen Curry \u2013 arguably the greatest player active in the game today \u2013 said he would not go to the White House to meet with Trump, who was to honor him and his team for winning the world championship of pro basketball last season.\n\nIn response, Trump withdrew his offer for a visit to the entire team n a tweet.\n\nGoing to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team.Stephen Curry is hesitating,therefore invitation is withdrawn! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2017\n\nTrump\u2019s withdrawal of an invitation \u2013 which had actually not yet been formalized \u2013 came shortly after Curry\u2019s position was discussed on the morning show Fox & Friends, which Trump is known to frequently watch.\n\nFox & Friends, 20 minutes before Trump's tweet pic.twitter.com/vyGKjQtgxZ \u2014 Stefan Becket (@becket) September 23, 2017\n\n\u201cVisiting the president in D.C. is customary for American championship teams,\u201d reported Sports Illustrated online. \u201cCurry, head coach Steve Kerr and other members of the Warriors have been outspoken against president Donald Trump, his policies and his stances on social issues in the past, and Curry\u2019s comments then come as little surprise after he said the same thing in June.\u201d The Warriors responded in a statement: \u201cWe accept that President Trump has made it clear that we are not invited. We believe there is nothing more American that our citizens having the right to express themselves freely on matters important to them. We\u2019re disappointed that we did not have an opportunity during this process to share our views or have an open dialogue no issues impacting our communities that we felt would be important to raise.\u201d\n\nThe Warriors announced that the team would still visit Washington, D.C. but this time it would be to \u201ccelebrate equality, diversity, and inclusion \u2013 the values that we embrace as an organization.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Warriors General Manager Bob Myers told ESPN that the team was considering a visit to the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture while in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nCurry had set the tone on Friday when he responded to Trump\u2019s comments in Alabama, where he had gone to support a candidate in a close special election for the Senate.\n\n\u201cYou can talk about all the different personalities that has said things and done things \u2013 from Kaepernick to what happened with Michael Bennett to all sorts of examples of what has gone on in our country that has led to change,\u201d Curry told reporters on Friday. \u201cWe\u2019re all trying to do what we can using our platforms, using our opportunities to shed light on that,\u201d added Curry. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of where I stand on that. I don\u2019t think us going to the White House will miraculously make everything better, but this is my opportunity to voice that.\u201d\n\nCurry was referring in his comments to Colin Kaepernick, who as a member of the San Francisco 49ers last season, kneeled during the playing of the National Anthem, evoking a blast of criticism and an equal amount of support. Kaepernick, despite an outstanding record as a quarterback, has been frozen out of football this season.\n\nHis other reference is to Michael Bennet Jr., a defensive end for the Seattle Seahawks, who in August sat down on the bench when others stood for the playing of the national anthem.\n\nBoth Kaepernick and Bennett were protesting the racism in American society and what they see as unequal opportunities based on race among Americans.\n\nWhen he protested, Bennett told ESPN \u201cIt would take a white player to really get things changed because when somebody from the other side understands and they step up and they speak up about it \u2013 it would change the whole conversation.\u201d\n\nThanks to the racist comments by Trump, Bennett\u2019s wish came true this past weekend, as white athletes on many NFL teams joined in the protests.\n\nThis is fostering many more conversations about racism, but also about the right of athletes \u2013 often highly paid \u2013 to use their sports platform to share their political views.\n\nTrump has also managed to upset many in his base who are avid sports fans and bring forth comments from some who agree with him.\n\nIn his bluster and efforts to paint sports stars who protest peacefully as unAmerican, what Trump has really done is show the huge divide in America which has only grown since he became president.\n\nTrump\u2019s actions and those of his Justice Department and others in his administration have had the effect of rolling back generations of efforts to enforce civil rights laws so that all people, regardless of their color, religion or where they were born, can feel they have an equal opportunity in America.\n\nInstead, Trump has started a race and class battle that is poisoning the atmosphere but is also firing up a new level of activism among many Americans who have just shrugged in the past about the inequalities in our society.\n\nSo Trump, by attacking peaceful protest, by his racist actions (even as he denies he is a racist), has done what politicians, money, and media have not been able to do \u2013 get people talking about equality, getting citizens fired up to speak out and hopefully in the future to vote in those who do believe America is for everyone, no matter their color or religion.\n\nAnd if that happens then the voters will have the final say to Trump, and the final words will be, \u201cPresident Trump, you are fired.\u201d"

Such policies may also provide that a student may, upon request, be granted access, to the extent reasonable, to a single stall restroom or shower, a unisex bathroom, or controlled individual use of a restroom, locker room, or shower.\n\n    Any student who willfully and knowingly violates this section shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $50.

Notably, it also provides for stigmatizing transgendered children by isolating them in a single person bathroom, which the Department of Justice ruled in June was a violation of the student\u2019s rights. It is a disgusting show of transphobia that has no place in our public schools; the GOP must accept that America is a multi-gendered, multi-ethnic nation, and no amount of perverted laws is going to change that.\n"

        "text":"Top ranking leftists provoke violence\nThe attempted massacre of dozens of Republicans highlights the Democrats\u2019 constant promotion of violence against their ideological opponents – rhetoric that has been espoused recently by Senator Tim Kaine and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch.\n\nFailed vice presidential candidate Kaine appeared on MSNBC in January urging Democrats to \u201cfight in the streets\u201d in resistance against the Trump agenda and the will of the American people.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much going on here that we clearly see, you know, places where… we can criticize what the administration is doing, but how does the [Democratic] party rebuild?\u201d asked host Mika Brzezinski. \u201cHow do you prevent a continuation of the bubble in a situation like this, and how does the party reclaim its reach across the country while fighting these battles?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, the way we get outside the bubble is we take advantage of this tremendous public outcry against the administration,\u201d responded Kaine. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve got to do is fight in Congress, fight in the courts, fight in the streets, fight online, fight at the ballot box, and now there\u2019s the momentum to be able to do this.\u201d\n\nKaine\u2019s son, Linwood, apparently heeded his father\u2019s advice and would later be arrested while attempting to disrupt a pro-Trump rally in Minnesota, and is now facing criminal charges. \n\n\u201cWhen protesters began harassing people gathered at the Minnesota State Capitol, rally participants attempted to block the entrance to the rotunda where the rally was taking place,\u201d reported the Daily Caller. \u201cProtesters then tried to force their way down the stairs, using smoke bombs, mace and fireworks, and causing a need for some rally participants to be treated by paramedics.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe love that our three children have their own views and concerns about current political issues,\u201d said Kaine in a statement on the matter. \u201cThey fully understand the responsibility to express those concerns peacefully.\u201d\n\nLynch also used similarly incendiary language in a bizarre one minute video in which she seemed to call upon fellow \u2018progressives\u2019 to march, bleed, and die in the streets – also in resistance to the Trump agenda, which has been endorsed and Constitutionally mandated by the American people.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s a time of concern for people, who see our rights being assailed, being trampled on and even being rolled back,\u201d she said. \u201cI know that this is difficult, but I remind you that this has never been easy. We have always had to work to move this country forward to achieve the great ideals of our Founding Fathers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has been people, individuals who have banded together, ordinary people who simply saw what needed to be done and came together and supported those ideals who have made the difference.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve marched, they\u2019ve bled and yes, some of them died,\u201d she continued. \u201cThis is hard. Every good thing is. We have done this before. We can do this again.\u201d\n\nThese are only two examples out of a stunning collection of calls to violence and murder from the intolerant, unhinged leftists in the Democrat party, mainstream media, Hollywood, and the spiderweb of interwoven organizations and cabals like Antifa and Black Lives Matter who have effectively transformed into domestic terrorists in Trump\u2019s America. \n\nToday\u2019s shooting of a top-ranking Republican Congressman by a homicidal leftist was inches from turning into a slaughter of unthinkable proportions, had it not been for a few brave Americans with guns – a God-given right Democrats work around the clock to take away.\n"

        "title": "Here we go again: AG nominee Loretta Lynch wants to free blacks from the 'Prison of Racism'",
        "text": "\nIf confirmed, it looks as if Barack Obama's nominee for Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, will be carrying out  Eric Holder's politics of racial vengeance. Based on her family history, social justice statements and close ties to black activists,  Lynch will deploy law enforcement resources based on race and political ideology, not on the rule of law.\n\nAs a young girl Lynch heard stories that her grandfather, a pastor,  hid people in trouble and helped them flee to the north to escape punishments under the Jim Crow laws of the time.\n\n    I realized the power the law had over your life and how important it was that the people who wield that power look at each situation with a sense of fairness and evenhandedness.\n\nLynch's father, Reverend Lorenzo Lynch, a Baptist minister, opened his church in the early 1960's to  students organizing  lunch counter sit-ins at Woolworth in Greensboro, N.C. where she grew up.  According to Lynch, her father carried her to those meetings, \u201criding on his shoulders.\u201d\n\nAfter graduating from Harvard Law, Lynch worked on Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign. CORRECTION: The Loretta Lynch who worked on the Clinton campaign is a different person.\n\nFrom 1994 to 1998, Lynch was a partner in  Connecticut-based Ujamaa Investment Group. According to David Horowitz's Discover the Networks site, \u201cUjamaa\u201d is a Swahili term signifying a commitment to the practice of \u201cshared wealth\u201d and a repudiation of economic inequality.\n\nIn her first stint as U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York in 2000, Lynch made a name for herself  in the highly publicized civil rights case against a white New York police officer charged with brutally assaulting a Haitian immigrant.\n\nAfter leaving that post in 2001 Lynch worked for a New York law firm until 2010, when Obama appointed her to the same position she held under Clinton.\n\n    In 2011, at a  meeting in Moscow at the Higher School of Economics(HSE) with Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer, (known for lying to Congress about his role in  Fast and Furious), U.S. Attorney Lynch told the international attendees American police officers are basically corrupt.\n\nFrom HSE:\n\n    There are two spheres where my office is the most active...These are investigating crimes committed by police officers, especially those related to human rights violation, and investigating politicians involved in bribery and embezzlement.\n\n    Such investigations, Ms. Lynch admitted, are especially hard to carry out, since the formal principle of equality before the law is perverted here. Policemen often act according to the principle of corporate solidarity, protecting their colleagues, and politicians try to use their connections and influence in order to avoid responsibility.\n\nIn August 2014, in a closed door meeting, Lynch met with the family of Eric Garner, a black man who died after an altercation with a white officer. The Rev. Al Sharpton also attended the closed door meeting and said  Lynch assured the family that her office was monitoring a pending state investigation.\n\nLynch has a close relationship with Eric Holder and in a speech at the Martin Luther King Center in Long Beach, New York last year she vowed to continue his work at the Department of Justice and fight those in the \u201cdeep south\u201d who want to take away blacks' voting rights and reverse the progress of the last 50 years\n\nThen she asks the young people in the audience, \u201cWhat is it that makes you feel oppressed?\u201d \u201cIs it the prison of racism?\u201d\n\nLast week the American people roundly rejected Obama's divisive 'post-racial' racism and gave the Republicans one more chance to stand up for us. Will they say \u201cNo\u201d to another Ivy League radical determined to undermine our rule of law by stirring up trouble between blacks and whites? Senator Lindsey Graham has already stated Lynch is a \u201csolid choice\u201d by the President. Graham\u2019s  remark  begs the question, \u201cWhen is enough enough for these guys?\u201d\n"

        "text": "\nThe Trump administration has a penchant for its dismal optics and an almost impressive ability to continue lowering the bar to previously unknown depths. This week, Trump and his tribalistic cohorts opted to punish those seeking asylum along the southern border by implementing a \u201czero-tolerance\u201d policy that would call for the separation of parents and their children, an act so inhumane that it is inviting comparisons to Japanese internment camps of World War 2 and even the Holocaust.\nTrump attempted to staunch the bleeding by signing an Executive Order rescinding his own policy, but the damage was already done, especially given that it discredited his own claim that the policy was the result of a Democratic law and that he was powerless to change it.\nEven within the United States, many on both sides of the aisle have spoken out, including all five First Ladies (Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, Rosalynn Carter, Laura Bush and even Melania Trump), former Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly, and Republican Senator John McCain.\nBut the international community has been especially outspoken in its opposition to this administration\u2019s visibly inhumane agenda, including the purported account of Willem-Alexander Claus George Ferdinand, the King of the Netherlands, who posted a less-than-subtle threat to a president vying for his spot as one of the cruelest world leaders of this century.\nTrump may continue to blame everyone but himself for his own policies, but from Washington, D.C. to the farthest corners of the planet, his crimes against humanity are both evident and roundly condemned. And whether at the ballot box or in front of a judge or even \u2013 fingers crossed \u2013 at The Hague, he will, at some point, have to answer for his crimes.\n"

Reid departed from the group along with Miami Dolphins safety Michael Thomas, who, like Reid, continues to kneel for the national anthem.\n\nReid says Jenkins and the Players Coalition leadership went rogue in agreeing to a deal that did not receive the blessing of the group\u2019s members. \u201cWe didn\u2019t agree with that,\u201d he told Slate, \u201cbecause we weren\u2019t trying to cut other worthy programs.\u201d\n\nReid speculates that the pressure exerted on Jenkins to accept the deal came about because of Roger Goodell\u2019s contract negotiations. The NFL commissioner, who seeks a lucrative new deal, endures criticism that jeopardizes that deal from Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones for his mishandling of the on-field protests. The agreement with players, Reid speculates, helps Goodell make a deal with the owners.\n\nReid, who joined then-teammate Colin Kaepernick in refusing to rise for the national anthem in 2016, tells Slate.com that, contrary to the NFL\u2019s claims, the league did view their much-discussed financial pledge as a quid pro quo to get players to stop the pregame sideline demonstrations.\n\n\u201cWhen he asked me if I would end the protest in exchange for the donation and to announce the partnership for the proposal on Thursday,\u201d Reid says of Jenkins, \u201cI was like, \u2018Dude, no.\u2019\u201d"

Brown was a 12 year veteran of the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department before spending the last six years in the FBI.\n\nNeighbors saw smoke coming from the Brown residence and called 9-1-1 at approximately 11:50 p.m. By the time fire crews arrived on scene minutes later, the entire house was engulfed in flames.\n\n\u201cMrs. Brown\u2019s death was caused by a gunshot wound prior to the house fire,\u201d Walkerville Police Chief Pat Frederick said, \u201cwhile Mr. Brown\u2019s single-bullet head wound appears to have been self-inflicted.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe totality of the evidence leads us to believe this is a murder-suicide. We believe he killed her, set the house on fire and then took his own life,\u201d Frederick said.\n\nThe findings support conclusions by investigators Saturday that the couple perished in a murder-suicide during which the 4,000-square foot house was intentionally set on fire. Authorities outlined a likely scenario based on interviews with neighbors and comments posted on Mr. Brown\u2019s Facebook page.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nBrown is believed to have started the gasoline-fueled fire but spared the life of his beloved beagle, Dixie. \u201cPrior to the fire, he dropped off the dog at a neighbor\u2019s house,\u201d Frederick said. \u201cHe put the dog in a neighbor\u2019s backyard.\u201d\n\nA neighbor told WHAG that Brown appeared \u201cpanicked\u201d though it is unclear whether his wife was dead before or after the dog was removed from their home.\n\nThe motive behind the killing is still being investigated, but police say Brown was a highly respected agent with the FBI and very well liked in the community. \u201cWhat leads someone to this level of anger and violence with your wife, your loved one, who knows,\u201d said an FBI official who knew the Brown family.\n\nConspiracy theories are running rampant throughout many alt. right media outlets, leading many to believe this was another \u201chit job\u201d by the Clintons in retaliation for the FBI email leaks so close to the presidential election. Media outlets like Alex Jones\u2019 Infowars and WND are running with the theory that globalist assassins, working for the Clintons, had the Brown family murdered and their home burned to destroy any possible evidence.\n\nFBI Director James Comey refused to comment at this time but asked for privacy and prayer as the bureau comes to terms with losing \u201ctwo very close friends.\u201d\n"

        "text": "In a continuation of the ongoing police scandals rocking the New York City Police Department, three-month old infant Layla Smith has been pronounced dead following an August sixth incident. This closely follows the July seventeenth death of NYC resident Eric Garner after the use of a prohibited choke hold by officers against him. Garners death was ruled a homicide by the NYC medical examiners office.\n\nSuzanne Smith, Layla\u2019s mother, had been sitting on a bench in Queens waiting for the bus when Layla began to insistently cry. Knowing that her baby was hungry Ms. Smith began to breastfeed her daughter. Witnesses at the scene report that she was then approached by a NYPD Officer, later identified as Michael Fitzsimmons, who requested that she stop feeding the baby in public as it was \u201cindecent\u201d. Ms. Smith refused to comply with the directive and told Officer Fitzsimmons that she wasn\u2019t doing anything illegal. Officer Fitzsimmons again insisted that she stop and threatened to arrest her for indecent exposure. Ms. Smith calmly responded to the Officer that he could not arrest her because breastfeeding in public wasn\u2019t against the law.\n\n\u201cHe got so mad at her\u201d, said Tyrone Webb, who witnessed the unfortunate altercation. \u201cHe started yelling at her, saying that he was the police, and that she didn\u2019t know s**t about what was against the law. He got all red in the face, pointing his finger right at her nose. She just sat there and kept feeding the baby calm as could be, being real polite and reasonable. Someone else tried to chime in and tell him he was wrong and he told the lady to shut up and mind her business.\u201d\n\nAs the argument transpired the bus approached and Ms. Smith stood up and moved Layla to her other arm, momentarily exposing her whole breast to the Officer and other onlookers. Ms Smith then clipped her breastfeeding bra shut and went to get on the bus with her baby.\n\nSandra Parker, another witness to the incident, described what followed next: \u201cHe screamed at her to stop and told her that she was under arrest. When she ignored him and kept walking toward the bus he grabbed her by the back collar of her shirt and violently yanked her backwards. The poor baby just toppled out of her hands. She hit the ground and the poor little thing just started bleeding from her head. The Officer saw what happened and actually continued to cuff the mother while she began to scream. It was the most horrifying thing I\u2019ve ever seen!\u201d\n\nOnlookers grabbed the injured baby and attempted to staunch the flow of blood from her split head. Officer Fitzsimmons is reported to have made the statement to the crowd that \u201cit was an accident but you can\u2019t resist arrest\u201d. Layla was transported to Queens Hospital Center. Her mother was taken to the precinct for processing. Layla subsequently died, without her mother, from her injuries at the hospital.\n\nOfficer Fitzsimmons has been placed on paid leave pending a full investigation. The NYC Police Department has issued a statement expressing their concern regarding this \u201cunfortunate\u201d event and states that all citizens must comply with orders to submit to arrest peacefully so that accidental injuries can be avoided.\n\nLocal community leader and Smith family friend Harold Jackson has called for the arrest of Officer Fitzsimmons on charges of murder, calling his actions a travesty of justice. Ms.Smith was released from police custody with no charges being filed against her. The Smith family has not yet commented on the death of their daughter.\n\nUpdate- A candlelight vigil will be held at Alley Pond Park starting at 6pm Thursday Evening to remember the brief life of Layla Smith."

        "text": "President Donald Trump dramatically increased pressure on China to reach a trade deal on Sunday, saying he would hike U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week and target hundreds of billions more soon.\n\nThe move marked a major escalation in tensions between the world\u2019s largest economies and a shift in tone from Trump, who had cited progress in trade talks as recently as Friday. Stock markets sank and oil prices tumbled as negotiations were thrown into doubt.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday night that China was considering canceling this week\u2019s trade talks in Washington in light of Trump\u2019s comments, which took Chinese officials by surprise.\n\nU.S. officials did not immediately know if China would attend and the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s Office did not immediately comment. China\u2019s commerce ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBut the editor of an influential, Chinese state-run newspaper said Liu was unlikely to go.\n\n\u201cI think Vice Premier Liu He will very unlikely go to the US this week. Let Trump raise tariffs. Let\u2019s see when trade talks can resume,\u201d Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the tabloid the Global Times, tweeted.\n\nThe newspaper is published by the ruling Communist Party\u2019s People\u2019s Daily, but it not considered an official publication and does not speak for the government.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had described last week\u2019s negotiations in Beijing as \u201cproductive.\u201d\n\nBut a less than rosy update from United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, including details that China was pulling back from some commitments it made previously, prompted Trump\u2019s decision and jab on Twitter at Beijing, officials said.\n\n\u201cThe Trade Deal with China continues, but too slowly, as they attempt to renegotiate. No!\u201d Trump said in a tweet.\n\nGlobal financial markets, which had been largely pricing in expectations of a trade deal, went into a tailspin. U.S. equity futures fell more than 2 percent and stocks across trade-reliant Asia tumbled, with China\u2019s main indexes plunging 4 percent.\n\nTrump said tariffs on $200 billion of goods would increase to 25 percent on Friday from 10 percent, reversing a decision he made in February to keep them at the 10 percent rate after progress between the two sides.\n\nThe president also said he would target a further $325 billion of Chinese goods with 25 percent tariffs \u201cshortly,\u201d essentially targeting all products imported to the United States from China.\n\nTrump wants to keep some, if not all, of the existing tariffs on China as part of any final deal to ensure China lives up to its commitments, a White House official said on Sunday.\n\nMindful of his 2020 re-election bid, Trump suggested the measures were not leading to price increases for U.S. consumers. \u201cThe Tariffs paid to the USA have had little impact on product cost, mostly borne by China,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nTariffs on Chinese goods are actually paid to the United States by the companies importing the goods. Most of those companies are U.S.-based. American businesses, while largely supportive of Trump\u2019s crackdown on China\u2019s trade practices, are eager for the tariffs to be removed, not expanded.\n\n\u201cRaising tariffs means raising taxes on millions of American families and inviting further retaliation on American farmers,\u201d said Christin Fernandez, a spokeswoman for the Retail Industry Leaders Association.\n\nNevertheless, the president\u2019s aggressive strategy drew rare bipartisan support from U.S. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who urged Trump to \u201chang tough\u201d in a tweet: \u201cDon\u2019t back down. Strength is the only way to win with China.\u201d\n\n Aides set up platforms before a group photo with members of U.S. and Chinese trade negotiation delegations at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, China, February 15, 2019. Mark Schiefelbein/Pool via /\n\nOne Chinese trade expert said recent signs of resilience in both economies were breeding over-confidence.\n\n\u201cThe urgency is gone. So, it\u2019s likely to see a longer trade war,\u201d the expert said, speaking on condition of anonymity citing the sensitivity of the topic.\n\nNOT GETTING CLOSE?\n\nTrump\u2019s latest threat could be counter-productive, said Tai Hui, Asia-Pacific chief market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.\n\n\u201cAs we learnt a year ago, Beijing could be willing to walk away if the U.S. applies negotiation tactics that they don\u2019t agree with,\u201d Hui said.\n\n\u201cThat said, both sides have invested significant time and resource to come this far and are likely to want to preserve the progress achieved in recent months.\u201d\n\nAs recently as Friday, Trump said talks with China were going well.. Mnuchin expressed hope last week that the Beijing and Washington rounds would lead U.S. advisers to a recommendation to Trump on whether a deal was reachable, and a White House official told Reuters that dates were being looked at for a potential meeting between Trump and Xi in June.\n\nWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told Fox News that the president\u2019s tweet was a warning to China.\n\n\u201cThe president is, I think, issuing a warning here, that, you know, we bent over backwards earlier, we suspended the 25 percent tariff to 10 and then we\u2019ve left it there. That may not be forever if the talks don\u2019t work out,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Michael Pillsbury, an informal trade adviser to Trump and the director for Chinese strategy at the Hudson Institute, said Kudlow\u2019s remarks downplayed the president\u2019s intent.\n\n Chinese and U.S. flags are set up for a meeting during a visit by U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao at China's Ministry of Transport in Beijing, China April 27, 2018. /Jason Lee/\n\n\u201cI take the president\u2019s tweet at face value. I was disappointed that Larry Kudlow downgraded it to a mere warning, which may tend to undermine American credibility as the Chinese delegation prepares its position\u201d ahead of this week\u2019s talks, he said.\n\nLast week, industry sources said they believed the talks were in the endgame, but the Trump administration official said aides had told the president that significant hurdles remained.\n\nThe increase in U.S. tariffs on Friday will be the first move of that kind since Trump imposed 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods in September, coming on top of 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion of goods enacted earlier last year.\n\nNegotiations about tariffs have been one of the remaining sticking points between the two sides. China wants the tariffs to be lifted, while some U.S. officials believe at least some of them should stay in place as a way to enforce any eventual deal."

        "text": "U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday he would raise tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent on $200 billion of Chinese goods.\n\n A container ship arrives at Yusen Terminals (YTI) on Terminal Island at the Port of Los Angeles in Los Angeles, California, U.S., January 30, 2019. /Mike Blake/\n\nThe United States has levied tariffs on a total of $250 billion of Chinese imports, global steel and aluminum imports, and shipments of washing machines and solar panels since January 2018, when Trump\u2019s administration levied its first trade tariffs.\n\nTrump has referred to himself as a \u201cTariff Man\u201d and says the duties he has imposed on a range of goods and metal imports are filling up state coffers.\n\nThrough mid-March, Washington netted $15.6 billion through tariffs imposed since February 2018, according to data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Customs duties receipts in the first half of the current fiscal year, which began on Oct. 1, have shot up by 89 percent from a year ago to $34.7 billion, data from U.S. Treasury shows.\n\nWHO IS PAYING THE TARIFFS?\n\nTrump says China foots the bill for U.S. tariffs on imported Chinese good.\n\n\u201cFor 10 months, China has been paying Tariffs to the USA\u201d he wrote on Twitter on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe have billions of dollars coming into our Treasury \u2014 billions \u2014 from China. We never had 10 cents coming into our Treasury; now we have billions coming in,\u201d he said on Jan. 24.\n\nPAID AT CUSTOMS\n\nA tariff is a tax on imports. The CBP typically requires importers to pay the duties within 10 days of their shipments clearing customs.\n\nSo the tariffs are paid to the U.S. government by importing companies. Most importers of Chinese-made goods are U.S. companies, or the U.S.-registered units of foreign companies that import goods from China.\n\nEvery item imported into the United States legally has a customs code. Importers are expected to check the tariffs and other taxes and duties due on the goods they bring in, calculate what they owe, and pay it.\n\nThe CBP reviews the payments. If it discovers an underpayment, U.S. customs will send the importer a fresh bill.\n\nDO U.S. IMPORTERS PASS ON THE COSTS OF TARIFFS TO THEIR SUPPLIERS IN CHINA?\n\nSome of them do, yes. So Chinese companies pay some of the cost. An importing company paying tariffs can manage the cost in several ways:\n\n1. Pay the full cost and live with a lower profit margin.\n\n2. Cut costs to offset higher tariffs.\n\n3. Ask suppliers in China for a discount to help offset the higher tariffs.\n\n4. Seek to source supplies from outside China. So some Chinese companies are losing business.\n\n5. Pass the tariff costs on to customers by increasing retail prices.\n\nMost importers could use a mix of those options to spread the cost between suppliers, themselves, and consumers or buyers.\n\nHOW DOES THAT ACTUALLY WORK?\n\nFor example, higher duties on imports of metals and Chinese products increased Caterpillar\u2019s production costs by more than $100 million last year. In response, the heavy-duty equipment maker increased prices for its products.\n\nTractor manufacturer Deere & Co estimates a $100 million increase in its raw materials costs this year because of Trump\u2019s tariffs on Chinese imports. Deere has cut costs and increased prices to protect its profits.\n\nA Congressional Research Service report in February found that the tariffs had led to an increase of as much as 12 percent in the price of washing machines in the United States, compared to January 2018 when the duties were not in effect.\n\nAccording to a study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics, the steel and aluminum tariffs increased the price of steel products by nearly 9 percent last year, pushing up costs for steel users by $5.6 billion.\n\nSeparately, a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Princeton University, and Columbia University concluded that the Chinese and steel and aluminum tariffs cost companies and consumers $3 billion a month in additional taxes and companies a further $1.4 billion in efficiency loses in 2018.0\n\nWHAT DO CHINESE FIRMS PAY?\n\nChina has retaliated against U.S. tariffs by imposing its own tariffs on imports from the United States.\n\nMost importers in China are Chinese. So in the same way the U.S. government is receiving import taxes on Chinese goods from U.S. importers, the Chinese government is receiving taxes on U.S. goods from Chinese importers.\n\nWHAT\u2019S THE TOTAL BILL?\n\nTrump has imposed a 25 percent tax on $50 billion of Chinese goods, and a 10 percent tax on goods worth $200 billion more. That, in theory, would mean the U.S government would receive a total of $32.5 billion per year on top of whatever duties were already in place.\n\nU.S. tariff revenue in 2018 was $49.7 billion. That was up 41.2 percent from the $35.2 billion in 2017 before the trade wars started.\n\nChina has imposed 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion of U.S. imports, and also has tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on $60 billion more. That equates to around $15.5 billion to $18.5 billion in tariffs.\n\nChinese tariff revenue in 2018 was 284.8 billion yuan ($42.41 billion), down from 299.8 billion yuan ($44.65 billion) in 2017.\n\n($1 = 6.7148 Chinese yuan renminbi)"

A large portion of the market will give the situation the benefit of the doubt to see what China\u2019s reaction is. If China reacts in a negative way and it turns out to be an escalation the market would see further headwinds.\u201d\n\nThe S&P 500 has gained 17.5% so far this year partly due to a decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve to put rate hikes on hold but also due to hopes for a China deal. \n\n\u201cI do think it\u2019s hard for the market to go higher from here without a resolution,\u201d said Rick Meckler, Partner, Cherry Lane Investments, New Vernon, New Jersey."

Fred Dufour/Pool via /\n\nIn a sign of increasing frustration at what it sees as a lackluster U.S. response, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government is signaling it could withhold cooperation on major issues.\n\nChina has upped the pressure on Canada in recent weeks over the arrest of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, arrested last December on a U.S. warrant. It halted Canadian canola imports and last week suspended the permits of two major pork producers.\n\nAfter Meng\u2019s Vancouver arrest, Chinese police also detained two Canadian citizens.\n\nBeijing is refusing to allow a Canadian trade delegation to visit, forcing officials to use video conference calls as they try to negate a major threat to commodity exports.\n\nWith no cards to play against China without risking significant economic damage, Canada has launched a full-court press in Washington, which is negotiating its own trade deal with Beijing.\n\nThe results have been meager.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very challenging situation.

In March, the Foreign Relations Committee responded to Canada's concerns by passing a bipartisan resolution supporting the country. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2DOl1Zi)\n\nCanada says the United States is obliged to help, given that the U.S. arrest warrant triggered the crisis with Beijing.\n\nU.S. negotiators have rejected Chinese proposals to include the Huawei issue in their current trade deal discussions, according to a source familiar with the negotiations.\n\nCanada\u2019s U.S. ambassador David MacNaughton, who noted Canada has assisted the current U.S. administration on diplomatic efforts with Venezuela, Latvia and NATO, strongly suggested future requests for aid would not be met so positively unless Washington cooperated more.\n\n\u201cHow do you go to canola farmers and relatives of the two (Canadian detainees) and say \u2018Well, actually, notwithstanding all of this, we\u2019re going to try and do whatever we can to help?\u2019\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt makes it much more difficult in public opinion terms for the prime minister to have permission to do some of the things that would be in both countries\u2019 interests.\u201d\n\nMacNaughton, who has cabinet-level status in Trudeau\u2019s government, played a key role in negotiating a new North American trade deal last year.\n\nRelations between Trump and Trudeau are formal at best. Officials in Ottawa have not forgotten that the president blew up last year\u2019s Group of Seven summit in Canada by describing Trudeau as very dishonest and weak.\n\n\u201cAt the political level, this administration doesn\u2019t like us very much,\u201d said a second well-placed source.\n\nIntertwined with the China crisis is a second problem: the tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum that Trump imposed last year on national security grounds.\n\n A canola crop used for making cooking oil sits in full bloom on the Canadian prairies near Fort Macleod, Alberta, July 11, 2011. /Todd Korol/\n\nMeng, who is under house arrest at her Vancouver mansion, next appears in court on May 8 ahead of an extradition hearing, in a process that could take years.\n\nMacNaughton said part of Canada\u2019s frustration also stems from a lack of information on U.S. intentions toward Meng. Trump has previously suggested the charges against her could be dropped if that would help the trade talks.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve said is, \u2018We\u2019d like to have a little better sense of what your plans are in terms of dealing with her.

        "title": "Fed faces tough sell on inflation framework",
        "text": "Federal Reserve policymakers fear they are ill-equipped to battle the next recession under their current inflation-targeting approach, and this year are well into an effort to vet new strategies for managing interest rates in a world of muted inflation and low borrowing costs.\n\n The Federal Reserve building is pictured in Washington, DC, U.S., August 22, 2018. /Chris Wattie/\n\nBut for the U.S. central bankers and monetary policy experts who converged in Palo Alto Friday to discuss available options, the challenge was clear: not only will it be difficult to settle on a better framework before the next recession hits, figuring out how to explain it to the public so that it actually works will be a major challenge.\n\nIndeed, just to explain their ideas to each other, Fed policymakers and academics at the Hoover Institution\u2019s annual conference displayed slide after slide crammed with equations, lengthy bullet points, and nearly indecipherable charts.\n\nAnd while most of the PhD economists in the audience presumably understood the theories, \u201cI think where people disagree is, do the assumptions of the model really play out in real life?\u201d Cleveland Fed Bank President Loretta Mester said in an interview on the sidelines of the conference.\n\nIn other words, what will really work?\n\nWhen central bankers around the world reached for unconventional tools like bond buying and forward guidance to fight the 2007-2009 financial crisis, they thought they were facing once-in-a-lifetime conditions.\n\nBut a decade on from the end of the Great Recession, it\u2019s clear the Fed is dealing with a new economic norm. Neither inflation nor interest rates are expected to rise much even with U.S. unemployment at a near 50-year low.\n\nThat leaves the central bank with much less leeway to cut interest rates to stimulate the economy than it historically has had.\n\nSo this year, with the U.S. economy on an even keel, interest rate policy on pause, and an expansion set to reach record length this summer, Fed policymakers figure they have a bit of breathing room to figure out how to make policy more effective when the next recession or shock comes along.\n\nAmong the ideas: commit to making up for bouts of low inflation with periods of above-target inflation; target economic output, rather than inflation directly; and use negative interest rates to force businesses to invest and banks to lend during downturns.\n\nSHOCK ABSORBERS FOR A NEW WORLD\n\nAll would, their advocates say, act as shock absorbers to cushion economic weakness and shorten recessions.\n\nEach would differ, to greater or lesser degrees, from the Fed\u2019s current approach, by which it aims for 2 percent inflation and a loosely defined ideal of full employment.\n\nAnd all would depend critically on households, businesses and financial markets understanding the framework, and reacting accordingly.\n\nAverage inflation targeting is the framework option that has attracted the most support so far. The idea, New York Fed President John Williams explained, is to aim for inflation to average out at 2 percent over a given period - say, a year and a half.\n\nWhen inflation falls during periods of economic stress, the central bank would respond by keeping easy policy in place until inflation rises above 2 percent and stays there for a time.\n\nIf households and businesses know they can count on higher inflation in the future, they will borrow and spend more during recessions, which would theoretically speed the economy\u2019s return to health. But for the plan to work, spenders will have to believe the Fed really will drive inflation higher in the future.\n\nBy contrast, negative rates would stimulate the economy by punishing businesses for not putting money to work in the economy; if they just keep their money at the bank, they\u2019ll end up paying for the privilege. For such a regime to be accepted, however, ordinary people would need to feel sure they wouldn\u2019t be punished as well.\n\nFed policymakers have largely rejected negative rates, but some central banks have tried it and academics like Harvard University professor Kenneth Rogoff, who presented his work at the Hoover conference, maintain it is a viable option.\n\nNot everyone at the conference was sold on the benefits of a new framework, not even the Fed policymakers who were presenting some of the ideas.\n\n\u201cThe bar for change is high,\u201d San Francisco Fed chief Mary Daly said. \u201cIt can be costly to make mistakes in this space.\u201d\n\nSt. Louis Fed chief James Bullard has long advocated a framework known as nominal GDP targeting where the Fed would target a specific level of economic output rather than prices directly.\n\nBut even as he gave a new pitch for the idea, he expressed trepidation with such a radical change: experimenting with the way the world\u2019s biggest central bank does business, he said, could \u201cunleash chaos\u201d in global financial markets.\n\nOne of the challenges of selling a new framework is that for the past 10 years, central banks globally have failed to deliver on their current 2-percent inflation targets, the prevailing international standard.\n\nTo Cleveland Fed\u2019s Mester, having a set of rules, whatever they may be, could make policy more effective by making it easier for people to understand the aims, and limits, of Fed actions.\n\nAnd Fed policymakers in Palo Alto seemed keen on exploring new ideas. The Fed has half a dozen more events around the framework review planned for the rest of the year.\n\nMost in the audience gave the Fed credit for tackling the issue. Said Dartmouth College economics professor Andy Levin, \u201cThe Fed needs to find something new.\u201d"

        "text": "Occidental Petroleum Corp increased the cash component of its $38 billion bid to acquire Anadarko Petroleum Corp on Sunday, removing a requirement for any deal to receive the approval of Occidental\u2019s shareholders.\n\nThe logo of Occidental Petroleum is displayed on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 30, 2019. /Brendan McDermid\n\nThe move means Occidental shareholders who oppose the bid, including T Rowe Price, will not get an opportunity to vote it down. It adds more certainty to the offer for Anadarko, but also risks the ire of billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who sources have said has been amassing a stake in Occidental to challenge its Anadarko offer.\n\nOccidental is trying to convince Anadarko to accept its offer and abandon its agreed $33 billion sale to Chevron Corp. Anadarko said on Monday that Occidental\u2019s bid could be potentially superior to the deal with Chevron, but negotiations are continuing.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, France\u2019s Total SA said it has agreed with Occidental to buy the African assets of Anadarko for $8.8 billion, should the two U.S. oil and gas companies clinch a deal to combine. This removes the risk of Occidental not being able to shed Anadarko assets it considers non-core to the deal.\n\nOn Tuesday, Occidental also secured a $10 billion investment from Warren Buffet\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc in support of its bid for Anadarko. The terms of that deal were seen as particularly favorable to Buffett by analysts and investors.\n\nOccidental submitted a new $76 per share offer to Anadarko on Sunday structured as 78 percent cash and 22 percent stock, as opposed to an even cash/stock split in its $76 per share offer previously.\n\nThis brought the number of Occidental shares required to fund the bid below the issuance threshold that would have triggered a vote on the deal by Occidental shareholders. Anadarko shareholders would still get to vote on the deal.\n\nThe bidding war for Anadarko underscores the value of its assets in the lucrative Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico. The vast shale field holds oil and gas deposits that can produce supplies for decades using low-cost drilling techniques.\n\n\u201cThe financial support of Berkshire Hathaway as well as the agreement we announced with Total allows us to delever our balance sheet while focusing our integration efforts on the assets that will provide the most value for us,\u201d Occidental Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said in a statement announcing the amended terms.\n\nHowever, a request made on Thursday evening by Anadarko\u2019s counsel for three board seats in the merged entity had not been granted, Occidental added.\n\nShould Occidental\u2019s bid be declared superior by Anadarko, Chevron will be given four days to match Occidental\u2019s offer, according to the terms of the contract between Chevron and Anadarko.\n\nShould Anadarko abandon Chevron for Occidental, it will have to pay Chevron a $1 billion deal breakup fee.\n\nThe proposed sale of Anadarko\u2019s African assets to Total includes a 26.5 percent interest in a Mozambique liquefied natural gas project, which is moving closer to a final investment decision, and stakes in two offshore fields in Ghana.\n\nOccidental said this does not impact the planned $2 billion of annual cost savings and $1.5 billion of annual capital reductions already outlined as part of its potential acquisition of Anadarko.\n\nTotal\u2019s previously outlined plan to increase its dividend by 10 percent and buy back 5 million shares by the end of 2020 will not be impacted by the deal, the French company said in a separate statement.\n\nChevron declined to comment on the Occidental move or say whether it will change its $65-a-share bid.\n\nSeparately, Occidental said its first-quarter adjusted profit fell 10.9 percent as lower prices for its crude hurt oil and gas revenue.\n\nAnadarko Petroleum Corporation is seen in The Woodlands, Texas, U.S., April 30, 2019. /Loren Elliott\n\nAdjusted profit fell to $631 million, or 84 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31, from $708 million, or 92 cents per share, a year earlier.\n\nProduction rose 18 percent to 719,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter, Occidental said.\n\nIts Permian Resources unit saw output rising 47 percent year-over-year to 261,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day."

        "text": "President Donald Trump dramatically increased pressure on China to reach a trade deal on Sunday, saying he would hike U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods this week and target hundreds of billions more soon.\n\nThe move marked a major escalation in tensions between the world\u2019s largest economies and a shift in tone from Trump, who had cited progress in trade talks as recently as Friday. Stock markets sank and oil prices tumbled as negotiations were thrown into doubt.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday night that China was considering canceling this week\u2019s trade talks in Washington in light of Trump\u2019s comments, which took Chinese officials by surprise.\n\nU.S. officials did not immediately know if China would attend and the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s Office did not immediately comment. China\u2019s commerce ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBut the editor of an influential, Chinese state-run newspaper said Liu was unlikely to go.\n\n\u201cI think Vice Premier Liu He will very unlikely go to the US this week. Let Trump raise tariffs. Let\u2019s see when trade talks can resume,\u201d Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the tabloid the Global Times, tweeted.\n\nThe newspaper is published by the ruling Communist Party\u2019s People\u2019s Daily, but it not considered an official publication and does not speak for the government.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had described last week\u2019s negotiations in Beijing as \u201cproductive.\u201d\n\nBut a less than rosy update from United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, including details that China was pulling back from some commitments it made previously, prompted Trump\u2019s decision and jab on Twitter at Beijing, officials said.\n\n\u201cThe Trade Deal with China continues, but too slowly, as they attempt to renegotiate. No!\u201d Trump said in a tweet.\n\nGlobal financial markets, which had been largely pricing in expectations of a trade deal, went into a tailspin. U.S. equity futures fell more than 2 percent and stocks across trade-reliant Asia tumbled, with China\u2019s main indexes plunging 4 percent.\n\nTrump said tariffs on $200 billion of goods would increase to 25 percent on Friday from 10 percent, reversing a decision he made in February to keep them at the 10 percent rate after progress between the two sides.\n\nThe president also said he would target a further $325 billion of Chinese goods with 25 percent tariffs \u201cshortly,\u201d essentially targeting all products imported to the United States from China.\n\nTrump wants to keep some, if not all, of the existing tariffs on China as part of any final deal to ensure China lives up to its commitments, a White House official said on Sunday.\n\nMindful of his 2020 re-election bid, Trump suggested the measures were not leading to price increases for U.S. consumers. \u201cThe Tariffs paid to the USA have had little impact on product cost, mostly borne by China,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nTariffs on Chinese goods are actually paid to the United States by the companies importing the goods. Most of those companies are U.S.-based. American businesses, while largely supportive of Trump\u2019s crackdown on China\u2019s trade practices, are eager for the tariffs to be removed, not expanded.\n\n\u201cRaising tariffs means raising taxes on millions of American families and inviting further retaliation on American farmers,\u201d said Christin Fernandez, a spokeswoman for the Retail Industry Leaders Association.\n\nNevertheless, the president\u2019s aggressive strategy drew rare bipartisan support from U.S. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who urged Trump to \u201chang tough\u201d in a tweet: \u201cDon\u2019t back down. Strength is the only way to win with China.\u201d\n\n Aides set up platforms before a group photo with members of U.S. and Chinese trade negotiation delegations at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, China, February 15, 2019. Mark Schiefelbein/Pool via /\n\nOne Chinese trade expert said recent signs of resilience in both economies were breeding over-confidence.\n\n\u201cThe urgency is gone. So, it\u2019s likely to see a longer trade war,\u201d the expert said, speaking on condition of anonymity citing the sensitivity of the topic.\n\nNOT GETTING CLOSE?\n\nTrump\u2019s latest threat could be counter-productive, said Tai Hui, Asia-Pacific chief market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.\n\n\u201cAs we learnt a year ago, Beijing could be willing to walk away if the U.S. applies negotiation tactics that they don\u2019t agree with,\u201d Hui said.\n\n\u201cThat said, both sides have invested significant time and resource to come this far and are likely to want to preserve the progress achieved in recent months.\u201d\n\nAs recently as Friday, Trump said talks with China were going well.. Mnuchin expressed hope last week that the Beijing and Washington rounds would lead U.S. advisers to a recommendation to Trump on whether a deal was reachable, and a White House official told Reuters that dates were being looked at for a potential meeting between Trump and Xi in June.\n\nWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told Fox News that the president\u2019s tweet was a warning to China.\n\n\u201cThe president is, I think, issuing a warning here, that, you know, we bent over backwards earlier, we suspended the 25 percent tariff to 10 and then we\u2019ve left it there. That may not be forever if the talks don\u2019t work out,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Michael Pillsbury, an informal trade adviser to Trump and the director for Chinese strategy at the Hudson Institute, said Kudlow\u2019s remarks downplayed the president\u2019s intent.\n\n Chinese and U.S. flags are set up for a meeting during a visit by U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao at China's Ministry of Transport in Beijing, China April 27, 2018. /Jason Lee/\n\n\u201cI take the president\u2019s tweet at face value. I was disappointed that Larry Kudlow downgraded it to a mere warning, which may tend to undermine American credibility as the Chinese delegation prepares its position\u201d ahead of this week\u2019s talks, he said.\n\nLast week, industry sources said they believed the talks were in the endgame, but the Trump administration official said aides had told the president that significant hurdles remained.\n\nThe increase in U.S. tariffs on Friday will be the first move of that kind since Trump imposed 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods in September, coming on top of 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion of goods enacted earlier last year.\n\nNegotiations about tariffs have been one of the remaining sticking points between the two sides. China wants the tariffs to be lifted, while some U.S. officials believe at least some of them should stay in place as a way to enforce any eventual deal."

In response, the U.S. has reconstituted its Second Fleet, whose area of responsibility will include the North Pole.\n\nThe Arctic Council\u2019s remit excludes military matters, but participants have already clashed, with the Washington Post reporting that the U.S. had refused to sign off on a final declaration, disagreeing with the wording on climate change.\n\nMELTING THE ICE\n\n\u201cThere are different tones with which different countries want to approach climate change,\u201d Finland\u2019s Arctic Ambassador Aleksi Harkonen said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about whether climate change can be mentioned or not.

        "title": "Facebook 'labels' posts by hand, posing privacy questions",
        "text": "Over the past year, a team of as many as 260 contract workers in Hyderabad, India has ploughed through millions of Facebook Inc photos, status updates and other content posted since 2014.\n\n Facebook logo is reflected in glasses in this picture illustration taken April 1, 2019. /Akhtar Soomro/Illustration/\n\nThe workers categorize items according to five \u201cdimensions,\u201d as Facebook calls them.\n\nThese include the subject of the post - is it food, for example, or a selfie or an animal? What is the occasion - an everyday activity or major life event? And what is the author\u2019s intention - to plan an event, to inspire, to make a joke?\n\nThe work is aimed at understanding how the types of things users post on its services are changing, Facebook said. That can help the company develop new features, potentially increasing usage and ad revenue.\n\nDetails of the effort were provided by multiple employees at outsourcing firm Wipro Ltd over several months. The workers spoke on condition of anonymity due to fear of retaliation by the Indian firm. Facebook later confirmed many details of the project. Wipro declined to comment and referred all questions to Facebook.\n\nThe Wipro work is among about 200 content labeling projects that Facebook has at any time, employing thousands of people globally, company officials told Reuters. Many projects are aimed at \u201ctraining\u201d the software that determines what appears in users\u2019 news feeds and powers the artificial intelligence underlying many other features.\n\nThe labeling efforts have not previously been reported.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a core part of what you need,\u201d said Nipun Mathur, the director of product management for AI at Facebook. \u201cI don\u2019t see the need going away.\u201d\n\nThe content labeling program could raise new privacy issues for Facebook, according to legal experts consulted by Reuters. The company is facing regulatory investigations worldwide over an unrelated set of alleged privacy abuses involving the sharing of user data with business partners.\n\nThe Wipro workers said they gain a window into lives as they view a vacation photo or a post memorializing a deceased family member. Facebook acknowledged that some posts, including screenshots and those with comments, may include user names.\n\nThe company said its legal and privacy teams must sign off on all labeling efforts, adding that it recently introduced an auditing system \u201cto ensure that privacy expectations are being followed and parameters in place are working as expected.\u201d\n\nBut one former Facebook privacy manager, speaking on condition of anonymity, expressed unease about users\u2019 posts being scrutinized without their explicit permission. The European Union\u2019s year-old General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has strict rules about how companies gather and use personal data and in many cases requires specific consent.\n\n\u201cOne of the key pieces of GDPR is purpose limitation,\u201d said John Kennedy, a partner at law firm Wiggin and Dana who has worked on outsourcing, privacy and AI.\n\nIf the purpose is looking at posts to improve the precision of services, that should be stated explicitly, Kennedy said. Using an outside vendor for the work could also require consent, he said.\n\nIt remains unclear exactly how GDPR will be interpreted and whether regulators and consumers would see Facebook\u2019s internal labeling practices as problematic. Europe\u2019s top data privacy official declined to comment on possible concerns.\n\nA Facebook spokeswoman said: \u201cWe make it clear in our data policy that we use the information people provide to Facebook to improve their experience and that we might work with service providers to help in this process.\u201d\n\nU.S. Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat and leading critic of social media, told Reuters in a statement that large platforms increasingly are \u201ctaking more and more data from users, for wider and more far-reaching uses, without any corresponding compensation to the user.\u201d\n\nWarner said he is drafting legislation that would require Facebook to \u201cdisclose the value of users\u2019 data, and tell users exactly how their data is being monetized.\u201d\n\nTHE PROJECT\n\nHuman-powered content labeling, also referred to as \u201cdata annotation,\u201d is a growth industry as companies seek to harness data for AI training and other purposes.\n\nSelf-driving car companies such as Alphabet Inc\u2019s Waymo have labelers identify traffic lights and pedestrians in videos to fortify their AI. Voice assistant developers including Amazon.com Inc have people annotate customer audio to improve AI\u2019s ability to decipher speech.\n\nFacebook launched the Wipro project in April last year. The Indian firm received a $4 million contract and formed a team of about 260 labelers, according to the workers. Last year, the work consisted of analyzing posts from the prior five years.\n\nAfter completing that, the team in December was cut to about 30 and shifted to labeling each month posts from the prior month. Work is expected to last through at least the end of 2019, they said.\n\nFacebook confirmed the staffing changes but declined to comment on financial details.\n\nThe company said its analysis is ongoing so it could not provide any findings from the labeling or resulting product decisions. It has not told labelers the purpose or results of the project, and the workers said all they have inferred from their limited view is that selfies are increasingly popular.\n\nThe Wipro labelers and Facebook said the posts are a random sampling of text-based status updates, shared links, event posts, Stories feature uploads, videos and photos, including user-posted screenshots of chats on Facebook\u2019s various messaging apps. The posts come from Facebook and Instagram users globally, in languages including English, Hindi and Arabic.\n\nEach item goes to two labelers to check accuracy, and a third if they disagree, Facebook said. Workers said they see on average 700 items per day. Facebook said the target average is lower.\n\nFacebook confirmed labelers in Timisoara, Romania and Manila, the Philippines are involved in the same project.\n\nAmong Facebook\u2019s other labeling projects, one worker in Hyderabad for outsourcing vendor Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp said he and at least 500 colleagues look for sensitive topics or profane language in Facebook videos.\n\nThe aim is to train an automated Facebook tool that enables advertisers to avoid sponsoring videos that are, for example, adult or political, Facebook said. Cognizant did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAnother application of labeling involved the social network\u2019s Marketplace shopping feature, where it automated category recommendations for new listings by first having labelers and product experts categorize some existing listings, Facebook\u2019s Mathur said.\n\nPRIVATE POSTS\n\nFacebook users are not offered the chance to opt out of their data being labeled.\n\nAt Wipro, the posts being examined include not only public posts but also those that are shared privately to a limited set of a user\u2019s friends. That ensures the sample reflects the range of activity on Facebook and Instagram, said Karen Courington, director of product support operations at Facebook.\n\nFacebook\u2019s data policy does not explicitly mention manual analysis.\n\n\u201cWe provide information and content to vendors and service providers who support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our products are used, providing customer service, facilitating payments or conducting surveys,\u201d the policy states.\n\n\n\nEurope\u2019s GDPR also requires companies delete user data upon request. Facebook said it has technology to routinely sync labeled posts with both deletion requests and changes to content privacy settings.\n\nFacebook and other companies are testing techniques to curtail the need for outsourced labeling, in part to analyze more data faster and cheaper. For instance, AI training data for news feed rankings and photo descriptions for the blind came from hashtags on Instagram posts, Facebook\u2019s Mathur said.\n\n\u201cWe try to minimize the amount of things we send out,\u201d he said."

        "text": "Federal Reserve policymakers fear they are ill-equipped to battle the next recession under their current inflation-targeting approach, and this year are well into an effort to vet new strategies for managing interest rates in a world of muted inflation and low borrowing costs.\n\n The Federal Reserve building is pictured in Washington, DC, U.S., August 22, 2018. /Chris Wattie/\n\nBut for the U.S. central bankers and monetary policy experts who converged in Palo Alto Friday to discuss available options, the challenge was clear: not only will it be difficult to settle on a better framework before the next recession hits, figuring out how to explain it to the public so that it actually works will be a major challenge.\n\nIndeed, just to explain their ideas to each other, Fed policymakers and academics at the Hoover Institution\u2019s annual conference displayed slide after slide crammed with equations, lengthy bullet points, and nearly indecipherable charts.\n\nAnd while most of the PhD economists in the audience presumably understood the theories, \u201cI think where people disagree is, do the assumptions of the model really play out in real life?\u201d Cleveland Fed Bank President Loretta Mester said in an interview on the sidelines of the conference.\n\nIn other words, what will really work?\n\nWhen central bankers around the world reached for unconventional tools like bond buying and forward guidance to fight the 2007-2009 financial crisis, they thought they were facing once-in-a-lifetime conditions.\n\nBut a decade on from the end of the Great Recession, it\u2019s clear the Fed is dealing with a new economic norm. Neither inflation nor interest rates are expected to rise much even with U.S. unemployment at a near 50-year low.\n\nThat leaves the central bank with much less leeway to cut interest rates to stimulate the economy than it historically has had.\n\nSo this year, with the U.S. economy on an even keel, interest rate policy on pause, and an expansion set to reach record length this summer, Fed policymakers figure they have a bit of breathing room to figure out how to make policy more effective when the next recession or shock comes along.\n\nAmong the ideas: commit to making up for bouts of low inflation with periods of above-target inflation; target economic output, rather than inflation directly; and use negative interest rates to force businesses to invest and banks to lend during downturns.\n\nSHOCK ABSORBERS FOR A NEW WORLD\n\nAll would, their advocates say, act as shock absorbers to cushion economic weakness and shorten recessions.\n\nEach would differ, to greater or lesser degrees, from the Fed\u2019s current approach, by which it aims for 2 percent inflation and a loosely defined ideal of full employment.\n\nAnd all would depend critically on households, businesses and financial markets understanding the framework, and reacting accordingly.\n\nAverage inflation targeting is the framework option that has attracted the most support so far. The idea, New York Fed President John Williams explained, is to aim for inflation to average out at 2 percent over a given period - say, a year and a half.\n\nWhen inflation falls during periods of economic stress, the central bank would respond by keeping easy policy in place until inflation rises above 2 percent and stays there for a time.\n\nIf households and businesses know they can count on higher inflation in the future, they will borrow and spend more during recessions, which would theoretically speed the economy\u2019s return to health. But for the plan to work, spenders will have to believe the Fed really will drive inflation higher in the future.\n\nBy contrast, negative rates would stimulate the economy by punishing businesses for not putting money to work in the economy; if they just keep their money at the bank, they\u2019ll end up paying for the privilege. For such a regime to be accepted, however, ordinary people would need to feel sure they wouldn\u2019t be punished as well.\n\nFed policymakers have largely rejected negative rates, but some central banks have tried it and academics like Harvard University professor Kenneth Rogoff, who presented his work at the Hoover conference, maintain it is a viable option.\n\nNot everyone at the conference was sold on the benefits of a new framework, not even the Fed policymakers who were presenting some of the ideas.\n\n\u201cThe bar for change is high,\u201d San Francisco Fed chief Mary Daly said. \u201cIt can be costly to make mistakes in this space.\u201d\n\nSt. Louis Fed chief James Bullard has long advocated a framework known as nominal GDP targeting where the Fed would target a specific level of economic output rather than prices directly.\n\nBut even as he gave a new pitch for the idea, he expressed trepidation with such a radical change: experimenting with the way the world\u2019s biggest central bank does business, he said, could \u201cunleash chaos\u201d in global financial markets.\n\nOne of the challenges of selling a new framework is that for the past 10 years, central banks globally have failed to deliver on their current 2-percent inflation targets, the prevailing international standard.\n\nTo Cleveland Fed\u2019s Mester, having a set of rules, whatever they may be, could make policy more effective by making it easier for people to understand the aims, and limits, of Fed actions.\n\nAnd Fed policymakers in Palo Alto seemed keen on exploring new ideas. The Fed has half a dozen more events around the framework review planned for the rest of the year.\n\nMost in the audience gave the Fed credit for tackling the issue. Said Dartmouth College economics professor Andy Levin, \u201cThe Fed needs to find something new.\u201d"

The plane is predominantly used by Russian airlines like Aeroflot, but is also used by a few other foreign operators, including a low-cost Mexican airline.\n\nDozens of flights at Sheremetyevo were delayed because of the disaster."

It says an estimated 323,000 people have been displaced in northwest Syria since September last year.\n\nResidents say tens of thousands have fled their homes, many to camps on the Turkish border, since the latest offensive began. Some who failed to reach those camps sought shelter in olive orchards, residents and witnesses said.\n\n\u201cThe shelling and aerial strikes have increased in intensity and ferocity and the area hit has widened with more intensity,\u201d Naji Mustafa of the Turkey-backed National Liberation Front (NLF) rebel group told Reuters.\n\nRussia says Turkey has not done enough to evict jihadists from the buffer zone or to open the M5 and M4 highways that link cities held by the government and run from Syria\u2019s southern tip near the border with Jordan to the northern border with Turkey.\n\nOpening the commercial and passenger routes through Idlib province would reassert the state\u2019s control over a fragmented economy that sprung up during eight years of conflict and now facing U.S. and EU sanctions, economic experts say.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said last week that he did not rule out a full-scale assault on militants in Idlib province, after Russian officials publicly questioned how far they would continue to tolerate jihadist control. [nL5N22908I]\n\nThe Syrian opposition seeking to topple Assad accuse Moscow of using the jihadists as a pretext to step up attacks on civilian areas and put pressure on Turkey.\n\n\u201cThere has long been a Russian aim to capture these highways. This is rejected as a princple of our revolution and it would have meant the displacement of tens of thousands of people who live in the area and refuse to be under Russian (rule),\u201d Major Yousef Hamoud, spokesman for the Turkey-backed National Army, told Reuters.\n\nThe loss of opposition control over the highways would mean the loss of a financial asset for the rebels, as well as be a sign of their weakening hold on their last enclave.\n\nIt would also undermine a sphere of influence that Turkey has carved out in recent years in Syria."

If China reacts in a negative way and it turns out to be an escalation the market would see further headwinds.\u201d\n\nThe S&P 500 has gained 17.5% so far this year partly due to a decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve to put rate hikes on hold but also due to hopes for a China deal. \n\n\u201cI do think it\u2019s hard for the market to go higher from here without a resolution,\u201d said Rick Meckler, Partner, Cherry Lane Investments, New Vernon, New Jersey."

If the angle becomes too steep, the flow of air over the wing is disturbed, throwing the plane into an aerodynamic stall. That means it starts to fall instead of fly.\n\nAlthough the angle itself is key for onboard systems, the industry has debated for years whether such data should be included in already crowded cockpit displays because it is directly related to airspeed, which pilots already scrutinize.\n\nSome analysts and academics say having the AOA Disagree alert installed would have helped Lion Air maintenance crew diagnose a problem on the penultimate flight of the 737 MAX jet that crashed in October, killing all 189 on board.\n\nThe 737 MAX was grounded worldwide over safety concerns following the Ethiopian crash in March, killing 157 people.\n\nWhen the jet returns to service, all new aircraft will have a working AOA Disagree alert as a standard feature and a no-charge optional indicator showing the underlying data, Boeing said. That restores the situation found on the displays of previous 737NG models since around the middle of last decade.\n\nAirlines with grounded 737 MAX jets will be able to activate the AOA Disagree function directly.\n\nBoeing is also developing a software upgrade and training changes to the MCAS system that must be approved by global regulators before the jets can fly again.\n\nBoeing has yet to formally submit the upgrades to the FAA for approval but could do as early as this week once it completes a special test flight.\n\nFederal prosecutors, the Transportation Department inspector general\u2019s office and a blue-ribbon panel are also looking into the 737 MAX\u2019s certification. A U.S. House of Representatives panel will hold a hearing on the plane\u2019s status with the FAA\u2019s acting chief, Dan Elwell, and National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Robert Sumwalt on May 15."

Petrillo could not be reached for comment on the choice of prison.\n\nJack Donson, a former manager at the prison who now runs a prison consulting firm, said the camp was \u201ca great place for white-collar Jewish guys.\u201d\n\nUnlike most federal prisons, which periodically bring in part-time \u201ccontract rabbis,\u201d Otisville has a full-time rabbi, Levine said.\n\nThe federal Bureau of Prisons said in an email that only four of the more than 100 prisons run by the agency have full-time rabbis.\n\nAnother thing that sets Otisville apart is the food.\n\n\u201cThe availability for kosher food is much greater,\u201d said Michael Frantz, another former inmate, who founded Jail Time Consulting.\n\nThe commissary menu on Otisville\u2019s website advertises matzo ball soup, gefilte fish and rugelach, a pastry, alongside Doritos tortilla chips and Diet Sprite soda. Kosher items are marked throughout with the letter K.\n\nMichael Cohen, the former lawyer for U.S. President Donald Trump walks back to his apartment in Manhattan in New York City, New York, U.S., May 4, 2019. /Yana Paskova\n\nThe camp is not fenced in and inmates\u2019 movements throughout the day are not as tightly controlled as in more secure facilities.\n\nInmates are given jobs, which Levine described as \u201cbusy work\u201d like cleaning or emptying garbage.\n\nBut, in practice, work hours at Otisville are short, sometimes one or two hours a day, said Justin Paperny, a former inmate whose consulting firm White Collar Advice has clients in the camp.\n\nFor much of the day, Cohen \u201ccan pretty much do what he wants,\u201d Frantz said.\n\nThe camp offers weights and other exercise equipment, a basketball court, a tennis area and a baseball field, and bocce ball, according to its handbook.\n\nPaperny also said Otisville grants furloughs - temporary releases for inmates, usually one or two days, which can be granted for family and other reasons - \u201cin my experience more than other facilities.\u201d\n\nCohen is married to Laura Shusterman, 49. They have two adult children, Samantha and Jake.\n\n\u2018GROUNDHOG DAY\u2019\n\nCohen\u2019s celebrity could make his experience different from a typical inmate\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThere will certainly be some prisoners who will be enamored by his status, being the former personal lawyer to the president of the United States,\u201d Paperny said.\n\nHowever, Paperny said, Cohen is unlikely to face retaliation from Trump fans angered by his decision to cooperate against the president, because inmates in minimum-security prisons are serving relatively short sentences and want to keep them that way.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll find that because prisoners have such clearly defined release dates, they don\u2019t want to do anything that could lead to them staying in prison a longer period of time,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite its reputation as one of the country\u2019s more comfortable prisons, the consultants stressed that Otisville is still prison.\n\nThe guards, Frantz said, \u201cintimidate you a lot. They speak down to you a lot. It\u2019s not a pleasant atmosphere.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201c(Bureau of Prisons) staff are trained and expected to conduct themselves professionally, including the humane and courteous treatment of the men and women in our custody,\u201d the Bureau of Prisons said in a statement.\n\nLevine compared the prison experience to the film \u201cGroundhog Day,\u201d in which Bill Murray\u2019s character lives the same day over and over.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a boring existence,\u201d he said."

        "title": "Facebook 'labels' posts by hand, posing privacy questions",
        "text": "Over the past year, a team of as many as 260 contract workers in Hyderabad, India has ploughed through millions of Facebook Inc photos, status updates and other content posted since 2014.\n\n Facebook logo is reflected in glasses in this picture illustration taken April 1, 2019. /Akhtar Soomro/Illustration/\n\nThe workers categorize items according to five \u201cdimensions,\u201d as Facebook calls them.\n\nThese include the subject of the post - is it food, for example, or a selfie or an animal? What is the occasion - an everyday activity or major life event? And what is the author\u2019s intention - to plan an event, to inspire, to make a joke?\n\nThe work is aimed at understanding how the types of things users post on its services are changing, Facebook said. That can help the company develop new features, potentially increasing usage and ad revenue.\n\nDetails of the effort were provided by multiple employees at outsourcing firm Wipro Ltd over several months. The workers spoke on condition of anonymity due to fear of retaliation by the Indian firm. Facebook later confirmed many details of the project. Wipro declined to comment and referred all questions to Facebook.\n\nThe Wipro work is among about 200 content labeling projects that Facebook has at any time, employing thousands of people globally, company officials told Reuters. Many projects are aimed at \u201ctraining\u201d the software that determines what appears in users\u2019 news feeds and powers the artificial intelligence underlying many other features.\n\nThe labeling efforts have not previously been reported.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a core part of what you need,\u201d said Nipun Mathur, the director of product management for AI at Facebook. \u201cI don\u2019t see the need going away.\u201d\n\nThe content labeling program could raise new privacy issues for Facebook, according to legal experts consulted by Reuters. The company is facing regulatory investigations worldwide over an unrelated set of alleged privacy abuses involving the sharing of user data with business partners.\n\nThe Wipro workers said they gain a window into lives as they view a vacation photo or a post memorializing a deceased family member. Facebook acknowledged that some posts, including screenshots and those with comments, may include user names.\n\nThe company said its legal and privacy teams must sign off on all labeling efforts, adding that it recently introduced an auditing system \u201cto ensure that privacy expectations are being followed and parameters in place are working as expected.\u201d\n\nBut one former Facebook privacy manager, speaking on condition of anonymity, expressed unease about users\u2019 posts being scrutinized without their explicit permission. The European Union\u2019s year-old General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has strict rules about how companies gather and use personal data and in many cases requires specific consent.\n\n\u201cOne of the key pieces of GDPR is purpose limitation,\u201d said John Kennedy, a partner at law firm Wiggin and Dana who has worked on outsourcing, privacy and AI.\n\nIf the purpose is looking at posts to improve the precision of services, that should be stated explicitly, Kennedy said. Using an outside vendor for the work could also require consent, he said.\n\nIt remains unclear exactly how GDPR will be interpreted and whether regulators and consumers would see Facebook\u2019s internal labeling practices as problematic. Europe\u2019s top data privacy official declined to comment on possible concerns.\n\nA Facebook spokeswoman said: \u201cWe make it clear in our data policy that we use the information people provide to Facebook to improve their experience and that we might work with service providers to help in this process.\u201d\n\nU.S. Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat and leading critic of social media, told Reuters in a statement that large platforms increasingly are \u201ctaking more and more data from users, for wider and more far-reaching uses, without any corresponding compensation to the user.\u201d\n\nWarner said he is drafting legislation that would require Facebook to \u201cdisclose the value of users\u2019 data, and tell users exactly how their data is being monetized.\u201d\n\nTHE PROJECT\n\nHuman-powered content labeling, also referred to as \u201cdata annotation,\u201d is a growth industry as companies seek to harness data for AI training and other purposes.\n\nSelf-driving car companies such as Alphabet Inc\u2019s Waymo have labelers identify traffic lights and pedestrians in videos to fortify their AI. Voice assistant developers including Amazon.com Inc have people annotate customer audio to improve AI\u2019s ability to decipher speech.\n\nFacebook launched the Wipro project in April last year. The Indian firm received a $4 million contract and formed a team of about 260 labelers, according to the workers. Last year, the work consisted of analyzing posts from the prior five years.\n\nAfter completing that, the team in December was cut to about 30 and shifted to labeling each month posts from the prior month. Work is expected to last through at least the end of 2019, they said.\n\nFacebook confirmed the staffing changes but declined to comment on financial details.\n\nThe company said its analysis is ongoing so it could not provide any findings from the labeling or resulting product decisions. It has not told labelers the purpose or results of the project, and the workers said all they have inferred from their limited view is that selfies are increasingly popular.\n\nThe Wipro labelers and Facebook said the posts are a random sampling of text-based status updates, shared links, event posts, Stories feature uploads, videos and photos, including user-posted screenshots of chats on Facebook\u2019s various messaging apps. The posts come from Facebook and Instagram users globally, in languages including English, Hindi and Arabic.\n\nEach item goes to two labelers to check accuracy, and a third if they disagree, Facebook said. Workers said they see on average 700 items per day. Facebook said the target average is lower.\n\nFacebook confirmed labelers in Timisoara, Romania and Manila, the Philippines are involved in the same project.\n\nAmong Facebook\u2019s other labeling projects, one worker in Hyderabad for outsourcing vendor Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp said he and at least 500 colleagues look for sensitive topics or profane language in Facebook videos.\n\nThe aim is to train an automated Facebook tool that enables advertisers to avoid sponsoring videos that are, for example, adult or political, Facebook said. Cognizant did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAnother application of labeling involved the social network\u2019s Marketplace shopping feature, where it automated category recommendations for new listings by first having labelers and product experts categorize some existing listings, Facebook\u2019s Mathur said.\n\nPRIVATE POSTS\n\nFacebook users are not offered the chance to opt out of their data being labeled.\n\nAt Wipro, the posts being examined include not only public posts but also those that are shared privately to a limited set of a user\u2019s friends. That ensures the sample reflects the range of activity on Facebook and Instagram, said Karen Courington, director of product support operations at Facebook.\n\nFacebook\u2019s data policy does not explicitly mention manual analysis.\n\n\u201cWe provide information and content to vendors and service providers who support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our products are used, providing customer service, facilitating payments or conducting surveys,\u201d the policy states.\n\n\n\nEurope\u2019s GDPR also requires companies delete user data upon request. Facebook said it has technology to routinely sync labeled posts with both deletion requests and changes to content privacy settings.\n\nFacebook and other companies are testing techniques to curtail the need for outsourced labeling, in part to analyze more data faster and cheaper. For instance, AI training data for news feed rankings and photo descriptions for the blind came from hashtags on Instagram posts, Facebook\u2019s Mathur said.\n\n\u201cWe try to minimize the amount of things we send out,\u201d he said."

Roux has called for a full vote count, saying that he found ballot irregularities in some voting areas.\n\nCortizo, 66, said that his rival had the right to contest the results, but declared himself the clear winner.\n\n\u201cI feel content... we\u2019ve won,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nThe electoral tribunal said it would wait to count a greater percentage of votes before announcing a winner, noting that the second-place candidate had expressed reservations about Cortizo\u2019s win.\n\n\u201cI want to be clear, we\u2019re not going to accept any election result today,\u201d Roux said in a video he posted to Twitter. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do a public count of the ballots until we can determine the truth of what\u2019s happened here today.\u201d\n\nCortizo, a former agriculture minister from the moderate left Democratic Revolution Party (PRD), aimed to woo the country\u2019s 2.8 million voters with promises to fight graft following bribery scandals and the canal nation\u2019s role in hiding the wealth of global elites.\n\nThe former businessman also promised to clamp down on corruption after allegations of embezzlement of public funds in Panama, whose trans-oceanic canal handles some $270 billion of cargo each year.\n\nShortly before casting his vote, Cortizo told Reuters that he feared for Panama\u2019s reputation as a major financial hub and the impending verdict of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which evaluates countries by their measures to combat money laundering.\n\n\u201cWe are worried about it and we will do everything we have to do to prevent money laundering. ... We want a robust financial system,\u201d Cortizo said.\n\nPanama previously appeared on the FATF\u2019s list of countries deemed deficient in their measures to tackle money laundering. This year, Panama passed a law that makes tax evasion illegal.\n\nPanama\u2019s image was tarnished by a corruption scandal involving Brazilian engineering company Odebrecht and the Panama Papers leak of 11.5 million documents from Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca that detailed how the world\u2019s rich evade tax through offshore centers.\n\nPromises to curb white-collar crime have featured prominently in the race. The leading candidates presented proposals that would change the way public contracts are awarded.\n\n\n\nCortizo also said he would continue to deepen ties with China, but has suggested he might move more slowly than President Juan Carlos Varela, who angered the United States by signing several major infrastructure projects with Beijing.\n\nRoux offered a constitutional reform to strengthen the independence of the judicial branch. He is also calling for Panama to restore its image to attract investment.\n\nVarela is barred by law from seeking re-election."

        "text": "Tesla Inc on Friday was set to raise up to $2.7 billion in a record-setting capital raising for the electric carmaker, as investors scooped up a mix of new stock and convertible notes that will recharge the company\u2019s cash-depleted balance sheet.\n\n A Tesla electric car supercharger station is seen in Los Angeles, California, U.S. August 2, 2018. /Lucy Nicholson/\n\nThe company said in a filing that it had increased its offer to 3.1 million shares, rising to 3.5 million including a tranche for underwriting banks, from an initially planned 2.7 million, priced at $243 per share.\n\nThe filing also showed it would place convertible debt worth $1.6 billion, up from an initial planned $1.35 billion. That all pointed to buoyant interest in the offering and shares in the company rose 2.5 percent in morning trading.\n\nThe coupon for the debt offering, however, was set at 2.0 percent - the top of the indicated range - suggesting the company had ceded ground to investors to borrow so much.\n\nThe conversion premium at which the bonds can be exchanged for stock in the future, was also at the bottom of the initial range given by the company - another concession.\n\n\u201cSeeing the offering amount raised does not surprise me at all,\u201d Clement Thibault, senior analyst at global financial markets platform Investing.com.\n\n\u201cAs far as Tesla is concerned, the more money in the bank, the better.\u201d\n\nTesla\u2019s launch of a capital raise was greeted with relief by Wall Street on Thursday after a tumultuous year which has seen analysts and investors cast doubt on its ability to produce, sell and deliver enough cars to make a sustainable profit.\n\nThe company faces expensive challenges, including launching production in China, overhauling its U.S. retail and service operations and developing new models, including the high-volume Model Y SUV and a Semi commercial truck.\n\nMany analysts had calculated that without new cash Tesla - which burned through $1.5 billion in the first quarter and has seen demand for its cars soften - would not be able to carry out its plans.\n\nThe company said that after all costs had been deducted it could now get up to $2.7 billion in new capital from the offer. That compared to the $2.2 billion in cash reserves the company held at the end of March.\n\nBUY IN\n\nBillionaire Musk, whose fortune centers around a 20 percent stake in the $42-billion company, also doubled his initial commitment for buying shares and will now buy stock worth up to $25 million, the company said.\n\n\u201cThe fact that Musk could increase its share from $10 million to $25 million is in line with the usual marketing scheme,\u201d said Nord LB analyst Frank Schwope. \u201cMusk always tries to surprise with promises that are often not kept.\u201d\n\n Tesla CEO Elon Musk leaves Manhattan federal court after a hearing on his fraud settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in New York City, U.S. April 4, 2019. /Brendan McDermid/\n\nIncluding the option for underwriters to buy 15 percent in each offering, Tesla will sell about $860 million in new shares and $1.84 billion in debt.\n\nTesla had said on Thursday it would raise up to $2.3 billion in new capital through shares and debt. That included an offering of 2.7 billion shares worth around $650 million and $1.35 billion in debt, before issues to underwriters.\n\nTesla\u2019s junk and convertible bonds opened roughly unchanged from Thursday\u2019s close, with the bonds of its SolarCity unit higher, according to Refinitiv data. The $1.8 billion junk bond maturing in 2025 < 88160RAE1=>, which rose 1.8% Thursday to a high of 87 cents on the dollar, was last at 86.5 cents."

        "text": "U.S. trade officials rejected Tesla Inc\u2019s bid for relief from President Donald Trump\u2019s 25-percent tariffs on the Chinese-made Autopilot \u201cbrain\u201d of its Model 3 and other electric vehicles, one of more than 1,000 product denials linked to China\u2019s industrial development plans.\n\n A 2018 Tesla Model 3 electric vehicle is shown in this photo illustration taken in Cardiff, California, U.S., June 1, 2018. Picture taken June 1, 2018. /Mike Blake\n\nAccording to documents filed by the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office (USTR) and reviewed by Reuters, exclusion requests from Tesla and others for Chinese-made products from aircraft parts to biotechnology instruments were denied because they were deemed \u201cstrategically important\u201d to the \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d program.\n\nTesla declined to comment.\n\nThe company has separate pending tariff exclusion requests for duties on the Chinese-made Model 3 Center Screen and for the Model 3 Car Computer before USTR.\n\nTesla said in a securities filing on Monday: \u201cOur costs for producing our vehicles in the U.S. have also been affected by import duties on certain components sourced from China.\u201d\n\nThe denials illustrate a systematic approach by the Trump administration to thwart China\u2019s efforts to develop high-technology industries that Washington alleges benefited from theft and forced transfer of U.S. intellectual property.\n\nMade in China 2025, a program aimed at growing China\u2019s prowess in 10 strategic industries dominated by the United States, is at the heart of trade negotiations and U.S. demands for sweeping changes to China\u2019s policies.\n\nThose industries include new energy and autonomous vehicles, aerospace, semiconductors, biopharmaceuticals, robotics and artificial intelligence.\n\nECONOMIC HARM\n\nTesla first made its request to exclude its 3.0 Autopilot electronic control unit in July 2018, which it called the \u201cbrain of the vehicle\u201d when the Palo Alto, California-based automaker warned that \u201cincreased tariffs on this particular part cause economic harm to Tesla, through the increase of costs and impact to profitability.\u201d\n\nIn a March 15 letter, USTR general counsel Stephen Vaughn said the agency was denying Tesla\u2019s request because it \u201cconcerns a product strategically important or related to \u2018Made in China 2025 or other Chinese industrial programs.\u201d USTR issued a separate letter also denying a request for the earlier 2.5 version of the Autopilot ECU.\n\nIt was not clear when the letter was posted on a U.S. government website. Other exclusion denials were posted at the same time, including for industrial robots imported by Kawasaki Robotics USA and composite panels made by Hexcel Corp in China for use in various Boeing Co aircraft.\n\nSome less high-tech products cited in the 2025 denials included a wiring harness for a rear door imported by Lear Corp\u2019s Chinese joint venture, Kyungshin-Lear Sales and Engineering LLC.\n\n\u201cThe material composition of the product consists of insulated wire, connectors, terminals, tape, and conduit,\u201d Kyungshin-Lear said in its request.\n\nUSTR has received China tariff exclusion requests for nearly 13,000 products and denied 5,311. Of the denials, 1,166, or more than a fifth, contained the same language as the Tesla request, citing links to Made in China 2025.\n\nNO U.S. SOURCES\n\nTesla told USTR it was unable to find a manufacturer in the United States, adding that \u201cchoosing any other supplier would have delayed the (Model 3) program by 18 months with clean room setup, line validation, and staff training.\u201d\n\nTesla says it reflashes the Autopilot ECU with the latest Firmware created in California when it is shipped from China by supplier Quanta Shanghai.\n\n\u201cFor a product as safety critical to consumers, and critical to the essence of Tesla, we turned to industry experts who could achieve this quality and complexity in addition to the deadlines, which was not possible outside of China,\u201d Tesla wrote. \u201cWhen it comes to identifying a supplier, we cannot risk our customers\u2019 lives due to a defect from a supplier.\u201d\n\nThe Autopilot ECU, also used in the Model S and X, includes two printed circuit board assemblies, which Tesla calls \u201cthe brain responsible for Tesla\u2019s Autopilot functionality\u201d and the main safety system for the vehicle.\n\nTesla has a separate pending tariff exclusion request filed in December for duties on the Chinese-made Model 3 Center Screen.\n\nOther exclusion requests also cited the lack of U.S. sources. Kawasaki said there are no industrial robots manufactured in the United States, and it only produces robots in China and Japan.\n\nIn a previously unreported request, Tesla also asked USTR to waive tariffs on the 17-inch (43-cm) cockpit touchscreen control panel that displays navigation, media, audio, climate control, energy display, and all in-cabin controls.\n\nOther automakers have sought similar exemptions but have not yet received answers.\n\nGeneral Motors Co in late July sought an exemption to a 25-percent U.S. tariff on its Chinese-made Buick Envision sport utility vehicle. The Envision accounted for nearly 15 percent of U.S. Buick sales last year.\n\nGM has also sought exclusions for dozen of parts, including push button ignition switches and transmission bearings.\n\n A Model 3 Tesla vehicle navigates morning rush hour using the car's auto pilot feature in Los Angeles, California, U.S., March 20, 2019. /Mike Blake\n\nNissan Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV have also filed exclusion requests for parts, while Uber Technologies Inc asked for an exclusion for electric bikes rented through the Uber app.\n\nEven if the United States and China reach a trade deal in the coming weeks to resolve their disputes, companies may not see tariff relief for months or possibly years. People familiar with the talks say that some tariffs, especially those aimed at the Made in China 2025 industries, could remain in place as part of an enforcement mechanism.\n\nVice President Mike Pence said on Friday that the manner in which tariffs were removed would be part of that mechanism, aimed at ensuring China lives up to its obligations in any agreement."

        "text": "President Donald Trump and a senior U.S. House Democrat tightened the screws on U.S. Attorney General William Barr on Friday over the Mueller report, making new demands on him after an already tough week for the Justice Department chief.\n\nTrump said it will be up to Barr to decide whether Special Counsel Robert Mueller, author of the report on Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, will testify to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which wants to hear from him.\n\nEarlier in the day, House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler set a new deadline of Monday at 9 a.m. for Barr to comply with a subpoena seeking an unredacted version of the report before moving to hold Barr in contempt of Congress.\n\nThe two developments ensured that Barr, Mueller and his report will remain in sharp focus next week in Washington, where Congress and Trump are on a collision course over investigations being led by Nadler and other committee leaders.\n\nAt the White House, speaking to reporters, Trump was asked whether he would let Mueller testify to the Senate panel. The president responded, \u201cThat\u2019s up to our attorney general.\u201d\n\nBarr, who was appointed by Trump, testified on Wednesday for four hours to the Senate Judiciary Committee. He took heavy criticism for it from congressional Democrats, who have accused Barr of misrepresenting the findings of Mueller\u2019s much-anticipated two-year investigation.\n\nThe same committee now wants to talk to Mueller. His 448-page report unearthed many links between Russians and Trump\u2019s campaign, but concluded there was insufficient evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between the campaign and Moscow. It also described attempts by Trump to obstruct Mueller\u2019s probe, but did not say whether Trump had committed a crime.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a Republican, wrote to Mueller to ask whether he wanted to appear before his panel to discuss any misstatements Barr may have made about the special counsel\u2019s investigation.\n\nThe special counsel\u2019s office would not comment on Graham\u2019s invitation.\n\nIn a letter to Barr, House Judiciary Chairman Nadler set the 9 a.m. Monday deadline for Barr to comply with the subpoena demanding the unredacted report, as well as underlying evidence from the Mueller probe. He also offered to negotiate further to gain the Justice Department\u2019s cooperation, but made clear what would be at stake if Barr refused.\n\n\u201cIf the department persists in its baseless refusal to comply with a validly issued subpoena, the committee will move to contempt proceedings and seek further legal recourse,\u201d the New York Democrat wrote.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment.\n\n\n\nBarr on April 18 released a redacted version of the Mueller report. Nadler subpoenaed the entire document a day later.\n\nIf Barr does not comply, the House Judiciary Committee is expected to move forward on Monday with a contempt citation that could ultimately lead to a civil court case against Barr, followed by fines and even imprisonment for failure to comply.\n\nAlso on Friday, Trump said he will decide in coming days whether he will let former White House lawyer Don McGahn testify to Congress. Mueller\u2019s report said McGahn told investigators that Trump contacted him in an attempt to get Mueller fired."

A 2017 financial disclosure form showed that Trump had at least $130 million of liabilities to Deutsche Bank.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers had asked Capital One\u2019s chief executive in March for documents related to potential conflicts of interest tied to Trump\u2019s hotel in downtown Washington and other business interests.\n\nIn their lawsuit, Trump, a Republican, and the other plaintiffs accused House leaders of pursuing records for no legitimate or lawful purpose in hopes they would \u201cstumble upon something\u201d they could use as a political weapon against Trump.\n\nRepresentative Maxine Waters, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, and Representative Adam Schiff, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, said on April 15 their panels had issued subpoenas to multiple financial institutions for information on Trump\u2019s finances.\n\nTrump, who is seeking re-election next year, has aggressively sought to defy congressional oversight of his administration since Democrats took control of the House in January, including possible dealings with Russia, and has said \u201cwe\u2019re fighting all the subpoenas\u201d issued by the House.\n\nThe White House is also resisting other House subpoenas, including for Trump\u2019s personal and business tax returns, and sought to block current and former administration officials from cooperating with House investigators."

They were key swing states in Republican U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 electoral victory.\n\n\u201cWe are convinced by the evidence that this partisan gerrymander was intentional and effective and that no legitimate justification accounts for its extremity,\u201d the U.S. District Court in Cincinnati panel wrote in its decision, ordering the state to create a plan to fix the map by June 14.\n\nThe ruling in Ohio could be short-lived if the U.S. Supreme Court rules in June that partisan gerrymandering cases cannot be brought in federal court.\n\nIn partisan gerrymandering, one political party draws legislative districts to weaken the other party\u2019s voters. The lines are typically redrawn once a decade after the U.S. census, and in many states the party in power controls the decision-making.\n\nRepublicans control both houses of the Ohio legislature, as well as the governorship.\n\nFour congressional elections have occurred under the map and each resulted in 12 Republican representatives and four Democratic representatives, the ruling noted.\n\nIncluded in the 2012 map was the \u201c\u2018Snake on the Lake\u2019 \u2014 a bizarre, elongated sliver of a district that severed numerous counties,\u201d the judges wrote in their 301-page opinion, referring to the state\u2019s 9th district that runs along Lake Erie.\n\nOhio Attorney General Dave Yost, a Republican, said in a statement that the state will seek a stay and appeal.\n\nThe court said it will redraw the maps itself if Ohio fails to come up with a solution that the judges deem fair.\n\nThe ruling comes in a lawsuit brought last year by the League of Women Voters and the American Civil Liberties Union against the state\u2019s attorney general.\n\n\u201cThis opinion, declaring Ohio an egregiously gerrymandered state, completely validates every one of our claims and theories in every respect,\u201d Freda Levenson, legal director for the ACLU of Ohio, said in a statement.\n\nOhio\u2019s secretary of state, Frank Larose, a Republican who oversees the state\u2019s elections process, said his office will work to \u201cadminister fair, accurate and secure elections in 2020, pending the conclusion of the judicial process,\u201d he said.\n\nThe conservative justices who hold a 5-4 majority on the U.S. Supreme Court at a March hearing focused on gerrymandering in Maryland and North Carolina signaled that they were skeptical of lower courts\u2019 authority to block electoral maps drawn to give one party a lopsided advantage.\n\nCritics have said gerrymandering has become increasingly effective and insidious, guided by precise voter data and powerful computer software."

        "text": "From the 12th floor of Jenoptik\u2019s headquarters, chief executive Stefan Traeger points to his laser factory and the university that provides it with talent. Welcome to \u201cOptics Valley\u201d - a role model for Germany\u2019s East in a big year for the region.\n\nThree elections in eastern states this autumn are focusing the minds of Chancellor Angela Merkel and her allies, who want to win over voters unhappy that their living standards still lag the West 30 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n\nThey have work to do. The East was given big promises after reunification but its economy languished.\n\nAfter cash injections of 2 trillion euros ($2 trillion) over three decades, the East\u2019s economic output per capita is still three quarters of western German levels.\n\nBut the East is slowly closing the gap and several tech hubs are giving it hope of catching - and maybe eventually overtaking - the West.\n\nIn Jena, Traeger says his predecessors turned \u201cthe ruins of the old East German Carl Zeiss conglomerate\u201d into Jenoptik - a multinational lasers and imaging equipment group.\n\nWith most of the East\u2019s old industries long gone, Merkel\u2019s government is trying to encourage hubs like Jena to profit from disruptive new technologies.\n\n\u201cI do feel at times that here in the East, still today, there is this feeling of \u2018well, maybe it\u2019s okay that we just play\u2019. No, we want to win,\u201d Traeger told Reuters after presenting record earnings for 2018 and a bullish outlook.\n\nMany East German firms closed after reunification, so why was Jenoptik different? Traeger says its first CEO, Lothar Spaeth, a former premier of Baden-Wuerttemberg in Germany\u2019s West, saw potential to create a world-class business out of an \u201cunpolished gemstone\u201d.\n\nWith the aid of government loans, Spaeth built Jenoptik from the Carl Zeiss group, but at a price.\n\n\u201cIt was a very difficult time. Several thousand people lost their jobs,\u201d said Helmut Bernitzki, 62, who joined the forerunner to Jenoptik in 1984.\n\n\u201cWe had to expand into new markets,\u201d Bernitzki, now an expert in optical coatings at Jenoptik, said. \u201cWe fought to be profitable and to create jobs here again.\u201d\n\nIn a city of 110,000 inhabitants, 22,000 of them students, Jenoptik has channeled ideas from the university into specialized laser and optics products to give the company a technological edge.\n\n(For a graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2GGQUVz)\n\nPRODUCTIVITY PREMIUM\n\nThe upshot is high productivity: Jena\u2019s output per worker is the highest in the eastern state of Thuringia, and slightly higher than towns like Bielefeld and Bochum in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Federal Statistics Office data show.\n\n\u201cHere in the \u2018Optics Valley\u2019 in Jena, we have a very closely connected community and it does feel like Silicon Valley, on a smaller scale,\u201d said Traeger.\n\nHe aims to turn ideas stimulated by Jena\u2019s university into high-tech products that \u201ccreate and justify price premiums\u201d.\n\nGenerating this added value has eluded other industries in Germany\u2019s East. Solar power firms made a promising start in the early 2000s before Asian rivals undercut many of them, with the loss of thousands of jobs.\n\nThe Goethe Galerie shopping mall next to the headquarters of Jenoptik is pictured in Jena, Germany March 21, 2019. /Fabrizio Bensch\n\nDeveloping products that rivals cannot beat on price is the holy grail for the optics, biotech and artificial intelligence start-ups taking root in the East - many around universities and research institutes.\n\nBut for the East as a whole, productivity was three quarters the western average in 2017, the latest government figures show.\n\n\u201cThe availability of skilled labor is much lower in east Germany,\u201d said Reint Gropp, head of the Halle Institute for Economic Research (IWH).\n\nHis policy prescription: make the East more attractive to qualified migrants, and invest in universities, research facilities and urban centers. In short, be more like Jena, home to the Fraunhofer optics research institute and the Friedrich Schiller University, where 14 percent of students are foreign.\n\nThe East\u2019s appeal to foreigners took a hit last year, however, when Chemnitz, a town east of Jena, saw Germany\u2019s most violent right-wing protests in decades after the killing of a German man, for which two immigrants were arrested and one later released.\n\nINNOVATION CLUSTERS\n\nThe federal government is now encouraging high-tech hubs in Berlin, Potsdam, Leipzig, Dresden and Jena.\n\nThe initiatives are bearing fruit. For the first time since reunification, more people moved from the West to the East - excluding booming Berlin - in 2017 than the other way around, government figures show. Small and mid-sized enterprises are driving the revival.\n\nSuccess stories include Halle-based ProBioDrug, which is developing products to treat Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and Jena medical devices maker Avatera Medical, which people close to the matter say is considering a stock market flotation.\n\nNot all areas are thriving. In the Lausitz region south of Berlin, plans to phase out coal mining are worrying locals.\n\nUnemployment in the East - at 6.7 percent - is still 2 points higher than in the West, and the population is older.\n\nEasterners also feel their prospects are poorer. A recent study by the DeZIM institute for research on integration found a third of \u2018Ossies\u2019 believe they are treated as second-class citizens, about the same proportion as Muslims.\n\nFAR-RIGHT CURSE\n\nIn Jena, mayor Thomas Nitzsche wants to export his city\u2019s success to surrounding areas, where the far-right and left play on people\u2019s fears of being left behind.\n\nBetween 1990 and 2016, the East\u2019s population fell by 11.2 percent to 16.2 million, government figures show.

Mainstream politicians, business leaders and think-tanks agree: the East can continue on an upward trajectory if remains open to skilled outsiders to help its young firms grow.\n\nThe East, said Gropp at the IWH institute, has less to lose by taking a chance on new technologies than the West, where the auto sector and other mature industries face challenges from innovations like electric cars.\n\n\u201cEast Germany has a better chance of handling this more disruptive structural change, which can take place much more easily in new firms,\u201d Gropp said. Could the East even overtake the West? \u201cI think it could, absolutely.\u201d"

The United States, China and Korea will roll out those networks this year and next, and Qualcomm makes so-called modem chips that allow smart phones and other devices to connect to those networks.\n\n\u201c(T)here is a plausible prospect that an overly broad remedy in this case could reduce competition and innovation in markets for 5G technology and downstream applications that rely on that technology,\u201d the Justice Department wrote. \u201cSuch an outcome could exceed the appropriate scope of an equitable antitrust remedy. Moreover, it has the distinct potential to harm rather than help competition.\u201d\n\nQualcomm and the Justice Department did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nThe FTC sued Qualcomm more than two years ago over allegations the company used anticompetitive patent licensing practices to maintain a monopoly on the market for premium modem chips.\n\nThe claims in the case mirrored similar antitrust claims made by iPhone maker Apple Inc. The two sides settled during opening arguments at the trial between Apple and Qualcomm.\n\nThe FTC\u2019s case was filed in the final days of President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, with the lone Republican-appointed commissioner at the time formally dissenting against the action. Antitrust experts widely expected the case to be dismissed when President Donald Trump\u2019s appointees constituted a majority of the five-member commission.\n\nBut FTC Chairman Joseph J. Simons recused himself from voting on the Qualcomm case because of prior work he had done for the chip supplier while in private practice. Antitrust experts believe that left the commission\u2019s Democratic and Republican appointees deadlocked at 2-2 on the matter, which prevented the Republican-appointed commissioners from voting to dismiss the case and allowed it to proceed to trial."

        "text": "Qualcomm Inc shares fell about 3.5% on Wednesday as investors got their first look at the bottom line impact of a patent fight settlement with Apple Inc, including a multibillion dollar one-time payment and more modest future patent fees.\n\n A Qualcomm sign is seen during the China International Import Expo (CIIE), at the National Exhibition and Convention Center in Shanghai, China November 6, 2018. /Aly Song\n\nThe stock kept most of the 50%-plus gains of the past few weeks, reflecting investor relief that Qualcomm had found a path to resume supplying chips to the iPhone. But Qualcomm\u2019s forecasts suggested Apple\u2019s licensing fees were not a big enough revenue boost to offset a weakening smartphone market.\n\nQualcomm will book a one-time payment of $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion in the fiscal third quarter from the settlement, as Apple catches up on royalties that the iPhone maker did not pay while they were locked a legal dispute.\n\nExcluding that payment, Qualcomm estimated $4.7 billion to $5.5 billion in revenue, generally below the $5.29 billion analysts were expecting, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nThe shortfall was driven by a weak Chinese smartphone market, where Qualcomm believes consumers are holding off on buying new phones until new 5G networks roll out later this year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to having a 5G Christmas as the year ends,\u201d Cristiano Amon, Qualcomm\u2019s chip chief, said on a conference call with investors.\n\nThe Apple settlement, which includes a six-year patent license and a chip supply agreement, is expected to generate $2 per share in additional earnings, Qualcomm has said. Financial details have not been disclosed but the deal is expected to help Qualcomm regain the preeminent mobile chip position it held in the early 2010s.\n\nQualcomm estimated $1.23 billion to $1.33 billion in revenue for its licensing business in the third quarter, above analysts\u2019 consensus forecast of $1.22 billion.\n\nThe licensing revenue outlook includes royalties from sales of Apple products. Apple on Tuesday said its gross margin guidance, which was largely unchanged from previous quarters, included the Qualcomm settlement. The two disclosures suggest little short-term financial impact from the patent licensing deal.\n\nStacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein, said the Apple settlement was in line with expectations but the revenue outlook was disappointing.\n\n\u201cThat tells me that either Apple isn\u2019t giving them all that much, or it says the core market is horrendous, or maybe a little bit of both,\u201d Rasgon said.\n\nBut shareholders welcomed the Apple deal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just pleased to have Apple back in the fold,\u201d said Hal Eddins, chief economist at Capital Investment Counsel, which holds both Apple and Qualcomm shares. \u201cI think they both came out well in the deal and am very impressed (Apple Chief Executive Tim) Cook agreed to it.\u201d\n\nQualcomm shares dipped 3.5% to $83.35 in after-hours trading. They shares closed at $57.18 on April 15, the day before the Apple settlement was announced.\n\nQualcomm executives cited economic weakness in China as a reason for the lower-than-expected sales forecast. Apple said on Tuesday it saw a slight uptick in China sales toward the end of its fiscal second quarter, following cuts in iPhone prices and other factors.\n\nQualcomm remains in a license dispute with Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, but the Chinese company has been making interim payments as negotiations continue. Qualcomm resolved a dispute with Samsung Electronics Co Ltd last year.\n\n\u201cWe feel that the Apple resolution enhances our ability to resolve issues with Huawei,\u201d Alex Rogers, Qualcomm\u2019s patent licensing chief, said on a conference call with investors.\n\nQualcomm is awaiting a federal judge\u2019s decision in a U.S. Federal Trade Commission lawsuit alleging antitrust violations that mirrored Apple\u2019s claims. The outcome remains unclear after Apple, the major source of witnesses in the case, dismissed similar lawsuits of its own.\n\nNet income attributable to Qualcomm rose to $663 million, or 55 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31, from $330 million, or 22 cents per share, a year earlier.\n\nRevenue fell to $4.88 billion, but beat analysts\u2019 estimates of $4.80 billion."

While consumers may be putting off phone purchases longer than in the past, they are deepening ties with the Cupertino, California company\u2019s brand.\n\nShares, which have mostly recovered from an end-of-year sell-off, are rising toward a new high. They gained more than 5% in after-hours trading after Apple announced the results and plans for a new $75 billion share buyback. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2WdDgyh)\n\nApple said it expects revenue between $52.5 billion and $54.5 billion for the current quarter ending in June, above analysts\u2019 average estimate of $51.93 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nIn an interview, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said that iPhone sales started to strengthen during the last few weeks of the fiscal second quarter, including in China. \u201cThese, along with the continued success with wearables and so forth, give us some confidence that things are getting a bit better,\u201d Cook told Reuters in an interview.\n\nApple reported net earnings per share of $2.46 for the March quarter, down about 9.9% from a year earlier, compared with Wall Street\u2019s average estimate of $2.36. Actual net income declined 16.3% to $11.56 billion. Apple spent a record $27 billion on share buybacks and dividends during the fiscal second quarter. Buybacks boost earnings per share by cutting the number of shares outstanding.\n\nApple said iPhone revenues were $31.05 billion, slightly below analyst estimates of $31.10 billion, according to data from FactSet.\n\nBut revenue from wearables and accessories sales of $5.13 billion beat estimates of $4.79 billion, according to FactSet data.

Cook also said he is \u201coptimistic\u201d that the United States and China will soon reach a trade deal.\n\n\u201cThe trade relationship, versus the previous quarter, is better. The tone is better,\u201d Cook told Reuters. \u201cThe sum of all of this together, it helped us.\u201d\n\nInvestors are looking to Apple\u2019s services business to fuel growth as iPhone sales slow. Last month, Apple revealed a new credit card offering and subscription services for news, television and gaming, though only the news subscription is currently available to purchase.\n\nApple on Tuesday said it has 390 million total subscribers to both its own and third-party services on its devices. The company has set a goal of 500 million by 2020.\n\nTom Plumb, founder of Wisconsin Capital Management and an Apple shareholder, said the results looked good, especially the uptick toward the end of the quarter. But other shareholders such as Brian Pirri, a principal at Apple shareholder New England Investment and Retirement Group, said they took the results with a \u201cgrain of salt\u201d because expectations were low heading into the report.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the phones are the answer.

        "text": "A private detective agency hired by the diocese that oversees Kentucky's Covington Catholic High School says there's no evidence that the school's students instigated a conflict with a Native American man near the steps of the Lincoln Memorial last month.\n\nThe boys, some of whom were wearing red \"Make America Great Again\" hats, were seen in a video shouting, chanting and grinning at a Native American man, Nathan Phillips. (\"Make America great again\" was President Trump's campaign slogan.) After the video went viral, the boys faced immediate condemnation from many who said they were intimidating Phillips. Now, a report by independent investigators retained by the Catholic school the boys attend has exonerated the students.\n\n\"Our students were placed in a situation that was at once bizarre and even threatening,\" Diocese of Covington Bishop Roger Foys said in a letter to parents this week. \"Their reaction to the situation was, given the circumstances, expected and one might even say laudatory.\"\n\nThe firm hired by the diocese, Greater Cincinnati Investigation, concluded that students made no \"offensive or racist statements\" to either Phillips or a group of Black Hebrew Israelites and that they didn't perform a \"Build the Wall\" chant. Investigators said they came to these conclusions after interviewing over 40 students and more than a dozen faculty and parent chaperones, as well as reviewing footage from all major news networks as well as YouTube and Vimeo.\n\nThe lawyer for Nick Sandmann, the teenager in the red MAGA hat who responded to Phillips' chanting with an impenetrable smile, condemned the media for rushing to judgment. \"Every member of the mainstream and social media mob who falsely attacked, disparaged, or threatened this 16-year-old boy should hang their heads in shame and be held fully accountable in a court of law for their wrongdoing,\" attorney Lin Wood told The New York Times. Wood has said that Phillips will be sued for \"lies and false accusations\" about Sandmann.\n\nIn a statement after the incident, Sandmann said that he didn't feel like he was blocking Phillips' path and that it was \"clear\" that Phillips \"had singled me out for a confrontation.\" Phillips told NPR that the statement was \"a young man trying to alter his story to make himself look good.\"\n\nInvestigators said they tried to interview Phillips at his residence in Ypsilanti, Mich., but over the course of six hours, he never appeared and he has not responded to their request for an interview. \"Phillips' public interviews contain some inconsistencies, and we have not been able to resolve them or verify his comments due to our inability to contact him,\" they said in the report.\n\nNative American advocates were critical of the report. \"Maybe they didn't say overtly racist things, but the context of the incident needs to be analyzed,\" Dina Gilio-Whitaker, professor of American Indian studies at California State University at San Marcos, told The Washington Post. She called the report \"unfortunate and disgusting\" and said it \"sidesteps problematic issues \u2014 such as the fact they were all wearing MAGA gear, which is, unfortunately, a visual cue.\"\n\n\"We have a history of people in MAGA gear attacking other people,\" she said.\n\nInvestigators said most of the students who wore MAGA hats bought them in Washington, around the time of the March for Life. Some chaperones reported that on past trips, some students had purchased \"Hope\" hats to support President Barack Obama. In any case, investigators said, the school has no policy banning political apparel on school-sponsored trips.\n\n\"The MAGA cap that Nick was wearing provides no legal excuse or justification for the politically motivated accusers,\" Wood told the Post. \"Rather, it only confirms their bias and malice.\"\n\nInvestigators found that the kids did perform a \"tomahawk chop\" to the beat of Phillips' drum and \"joined in\" with his chanting but said that they could find \"no evidence of offensive or racist statements by students to Mr. Phillips or members of his group.\"\n\n\"As far as the tomahawk chop goes,\" Wood told a pro-life news website, \"I am an Atlanta Braves fan and the tomahawk chop is a fan cheer at baseball games that is intended to support the team and is not intended to disparage Native Americans.\"\n\nThe person who said on video that \"it's not rape if you enjoy it\" was not a student at Covington Catholic, the investigators also found.\n\nBefore the investigation, the diocese had said the boys could be expelled for their behavior. In his letter to parents, Bishop Roy said he was pleased that his \"hope and expectation\" that the boys would be exonerated \"has been realized.\" The students, who had traveled to Washington to \"march peacefully\" for the anti-abortion rally, \"could never have expected what they experienced on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial while waiting for the buses to take them home,\" Roy wrote. \"Their stance there was surely a pro-life stance.

        "text": "It is being reported that the popular restaurant chain \u2018Chipotle Mexican Grill\u2019, more commonly known as simply \u2018Chipotle\u2019, is currently being investigated for allegedly using dog and cat meat in their dishes.\n\nThe FDA suspected the chain was using dog and cat meat when an FDA inspector stumbled upon multiple live dogs and cat, as well as dog and cat corpses in one Chipotle factory located in Denver. The inspector notified the authorities and the factory was shut down. The FDA will soon force all Chipotle restaurants in the U.S. to prevent people from consuming dog and cat meat.\n\nBut why would Chilotle use dog and cat meat? FDA official Charles Wellington says \u201cIt makes sense for Chipotle to use dog and cat meat simply because it is much cheaper and easier to find than cow meat, many people love Chipotle dishes and don\u2019t even know they\u2019re eating dogs and cats because it\u2019s psychological, which Chipotle is aware of. As soon as people find out, they will all of a sudden think \u201cwait, the meat did taste kind of weird sometimes\u201d, it\u2019s all placebo\u201d."

        "title":"Kevin Hart to Replace Jussie Smollett in 'Empire' Hollywood Sources Say",
        "text":"Comedian, actor and producer Kevin Hart, recently the subject of social media backlash after old remarks and messages expressing anti-LGBT sentiment resurfaced, will reportedly replace indicted \u201cEmpire\u201d actor Jussie Smollett, industry sources with no knowledge of ongoing discussions say.\n\n\u201cI feel five-and-one-half feet tall, and on top of the world!\u201d said Hart, after a representative from WMA, the comedian\u2019s talent agency, notified the wee star of his recent booking.  The actor\u2019s height has been widely reported to be 5 feet, 4 inches.\n\n\u201cThings have been rough the past few months,\u201d said Hart, during a hastily arranged press conference, \u201cbut I\u2019m not going to let them get me down,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNot that I\u2019m apologizing for anything,\u201d he added, \u201cbut if I did have anything to apologize for, I would be the bigger person, but since I don\u2019t, and I\u2019m not, I won\u2019t, \u2018cause I didn\u2019t so I don\u2019t have to, because I\u2019m a Grown Little Man!\n\nAfter holding for applause that did not come from the assembled media, Hart tugged at his collar and \u2013 a l\u00e1 comedian Rodney Dangerfield \u2013 and said, \u201cWhoa, what a tough room.  I don\u2019t get no respect!  Now I know how Vice President Pence felt over there in Germany when he got the short end of the stick!\u201d\n\nThe Pence comment referred to a recent appearance in Munich by the nation\u2019s vice president, who offered \u201cgreetings from the 45th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump,\u201d but was met with awkward silence from world leaders and their representatives.\n\nIn a bizarre twist, Hart said he would not be able to start filming remaining episodes of \u201cEmpire\u201d until his \u201cvery big duties\u201d for the 91st Annual Academy Awards broadcast had concluded.  Hart was disinvited from hosting duties by the Academy, but his announcement hinted at perhaps a lesser, smaller, diminutive role during this year\u2019s award show.\n\n\u201cI guess little is big now,\u201d joked Hart, before driving off to film a promo for \u201cTiny House Nation,\u201d a renovation series highlighting the downsizing trend for houses under 500 square feet."

        "title": "Sri Lanka imposes emergency, says international network involved in attacks",
        "text": "Sri Lanka said on Monday it was invoking emergency powers in the aftermath of devastating bomb attacks on hotels and churches, blamed on militants with foreign links, which killed 290 people and wounded nearly 500.\n\nThe emergency law, which gives police and the military extensive powers to detain and interrogate suspects without court orders, would go into effect at midnight local time, the president\u2019s office said.\n\nColombo, the seaside capital of the Indian Ocean island, was jittery the day after the horrifying Easter Sunday attacks. Police said 87 bomb detonators were found at the city\u2019s main bus station, while an explosive went off near a church when bomb squad officials were trying to defuse it. Scores were killed in the church on Sunday.\n\nA night curfew went into effect at 8 p.m.\n\nThere was no claim of responsibility for Sunday\u2019s attacks but suspicion was focusing on Islamist militants in the Buddhist-majority country.\n\nInvestigators said seven suicide bombers took part in the attacks while a government spokesman said an international network was involved.\n\nPolice had received a tip-off of a possible attack on churches by a little-known domestic Islamist group this month, according to a document seen by Reuters.\n\nThe intelligence report, dated April 11, said a foreign intelligence agency had warned authorities of possible attacks on churches by the National Thawheed Jama\u2019ut. It was not immediately clear what action, if any, was taken in response to the tip-off.\n\nInternational anti-terrorism experts said even if a local group had carried out the attacks, it was likely that al Qaeda or Islamic State were involved, given the level of sophistication.\n\nTwo of the suicide bombers blew themselves up at the Shangri-La Hotel on Colombo\u2019s seafront, said Ariyananda Welianga, an official at the government\u2019s forensic division. The others targeted three churches and two other hotels.\n\nA fourth hotel and a house in a suburb of the capital Colombo were also hit, but it was not immediately clear how those attacks were carried out.\n\n\u201cStill the investigations are going on,\u201d Welianga said.\n\nPolice said 24 people had been arrested, all of whom were Sri Lankan, but they gave no more details.\n\nMost of the attacks came during Easter services and when hotel guests were sitting down for breakfast buffets.\n\n\u201cGuests who had come for breakfast were lying on the floor, blood all over,\u201d an employee at Kingsbury Hotel told Reuters.\n\n\u201cTERRIBLE, TERRIBLE THING\u201d\n\nCabinet spokesman Rajitha Senaratne said the government believed an international network was involved.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think a small organization can do all that. We are now investigating international support for them and their other links - how they produced the suicide bombers and bombs like this,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president, Maithripala Sirisena, said the government would seek foreign help to track overseas links.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump called Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to pledge U.S. support in bringing the perpetrators to justice, a White House spokesman said.\n\n\u201cA terrible, terrible thing. Unthinkable,\u201d Trump later told reporters at a White House event. \u201cWe are working with Sri Lanka.\u201d\n\nPope Francis deplored the attacks and called for universal condemnation of what he said were \u201cterrorist acts, inhuman acts\u201d that could never be justified.\n\nPeople who live near the church that was attacked yesterday, leave their houses as the military try to defuse a suspected van before it exploded in Colombo, Sri Lanka April 22, 2019. \nBuddhist-majority Sri Lanka was at war for decades with ethnic minority Tamil separatists, most of them Hindu, but violence had largely ended since the government victory in the civil war 10 years ago. The country\u2019s 22 million people include minority Christians, Muslims and Hindus.\n\nMost of the dead and wounded were Sri Lankans although government officials said 32 foreigners were killed, including British, U.S., Australian, Turkish, Indian, Chinese, Danish, Dutch and Portuguese nationals.\n\nDenmark\u2019s richest man Anders Holch Povlsen and his wife lost three of their four children in the attacks, a spokesman for his fashion firm said.\n\nA British mother and son were killed while eating breakfast at the Shangri-La, British media reported, while five Indian political workers were killed at the same hotel.\n\nThe U.S. State Department said in a travel advisory \u201cterrorist groups\u201d were plotting possible attacks in Sri Lanka and targets could include tourist spots, transport hubs, shopping malls, hotels, places of worship and airports.\n\n\u2018CARNAGE\u2019\n\nTraffic was uncharacteristically thin in normally bustling Colombo on Monday.\n\nSoldiers with automatic weapons stood guard outside major hotels and the World Trade Centre in the business district.\n\nAn Australian survivor, identified only as Sam, told Australia\u2019s 3AW radio the hotel was a scene of \u201cabsolute carnage\u201d.\n\nHe said he and a travel partner were having breakfast at the Shangri-La when two blasts went off. He said he had seen two men wearing backpacks seconds before the blasts.\n\n\u201cThere were people screaming and dead bodies all around,\u201d he said. \u201cKids crying, kids on the ground, I don\u2019t know if they were dead or not, just crazy.\u201d\n\nThere were similar scenes at two churches in or near Colombo, and a third church in the northeast town of Batticaloa, where worshippers had gathered. Pictures showed bodies on the ground and blood-spattered pews and statues.\n\nDozens were killed in a blast at the Gothic-style St Sebastian church in Katuwapitiya, north of Colombo. Police said they suspected it was a suicide attack.\n\nQuestions over why the intelligence report warning was not acted upon could feed into a feud between Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and the president.\n\nSirisena fired the premier last year and installed opposition strongman Mahinda Rajapaksa in his stead. Weeks later, he was forced to re-instate Wickremesinghe because of pressure from the Supreme Court but their relationship is still fraught as a presidential election nears.\n"
